       "\" \\n\\nFormer Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More\\n\\n  \\nWhenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.\\nHe doesn’t answer hypothetical questions\\nHerman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?\\nNow we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.\\nAlfred and Sir Humphrey\\nAh, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.\\nSo in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.\\nA few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).\\n“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”\\nIf Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.\\nA Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols\\nIn what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.\\n‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.\\nBeneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.\\nThe first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.\\nNo wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.\\nAh, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.\\n“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”\\nThose of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.\\nLabour loves the lira\\nThe other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”\\nOn Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.\\nOn the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”\\nThis was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?\\nNo respect\\nA front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.\\nPicking a fight with Europe\\nThe leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.\\nPicture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.\\nI remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.\\nI found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.\\nBug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”\\nI didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.\\nEnoch Lowell\\nNorman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.\\n“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.\\nNext to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.\\nThey continue to bore on about coalitions\\nThe Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.\\nWhenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.\\nCoalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.\\nThe way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.\\nEven if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.\\nThe result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?\\nThis kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.\\nYou can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo\\nMaybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.\\nLabour United\\nWhen the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.\\nThroughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.\\nPullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.\\nBullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.\\nSant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.\\nThe last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.\\nHe lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.\\nI can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.\\nThis must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.\\nWhichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.\\nFloods of tears\\nAlfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.\\nSo why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.\\nIf Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.\\nIronically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.\\nBooks and misprints\\nLabour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.\\nAnd yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.\\nThat should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.\\nGonziPN is a corrupt liar\\nAt least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.\\nBad language\\nFirst we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.\\nMiscellaneous fees\\nSome of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.\\nIf he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.\\nBut Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.\\nCharlon Gouder\\nNow this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.\\nCharlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.\\nSo far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.\\nHare Krishna of Maltese politics\\nAD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.\\nI can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.\\nAnd like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.\\nHe’s been inside him\\nNo, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.\\nTaken from one of the Internet posts\\n“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”\\n“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”\\n“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”\\nDivorce\\nSome people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.\\nThen I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.\\nBut AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.\\nSo let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.\\nThe secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali\\nA keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’\\nLots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”\\nThey sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.\\nAlfred Sant meets a pig\\nI happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.\\nThis isn’t me speaking\\nIt’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.\\n”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.\\nSant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.\\nPullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.\\nWhat a coward.\\nThen he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).\\nThe BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.\\nThose of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.\\nJa pufta\\nLabour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.\\nNow, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.\\nLabour United – they’re a winning team.\\nJenny Pullicino Orlando\\nThose who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.\\nAs Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.\\nHe is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.\\nWhat a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.\\nDearest Daphne,\\nThank you for shedding a human light on the situation.\\nI am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.\\nObviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!\\nI have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.\\nYou are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!\\nI hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.\\nThanks again, Daphne\\nHave a lovely day\\nJenny Pullicino Orlando\\n  \\n\\n  \\nA mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)\\nThen when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)\\nYes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nI have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.\\nWatch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.\\nAnd this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.\\nThe Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.\\nThis is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.\\nJeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition\\nBy that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’\\nAnd then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’\\nSant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.\\nHe had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.\\nSant calls the police\\nWhen he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.\\nThe days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant\\nPullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.\\nMy mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.\\nHe had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’\\nI was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.\\nAlfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.\\nAs he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.\\nJust as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.\\nI’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThey told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.\\nIt looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.\\nTwo weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.\\nChicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess\\nThe television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.\\nHighly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.\\nSuper One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.\\nWig glued on tight\\nIt didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.\\nPaired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.\\nMassing for war\\nI didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.\\nThere wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.\\nHad Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.\\nJo Said wants a bodyguard\\nLast week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.\\nSaid copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’\\nThat evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.\\n‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’\\nSo Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.\\nAnd now here’s Jo Said again\\nDid you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.\\nToday I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.\\nIn this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’\\nFascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.\\nYou know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nI’ve just finished watching BondiPlus. It turns out that just before Labour made such a great fuss about the Safi supermarket permit resignations at the MEPA (the project is one of Charles Polidano’s), Labour’s Lion of Change was seen eating lunch with Ic-Caqnu himself – his guest at the Le Meridien in St Julian’s. I wonder what he chose off the menu – half an ox, probably.\\nYou can’t do anything on this island, can you?\\nAnd so the lovely Rachel Attard found out and confronted the unlovely Alfred Sant under one of his many tents. Sant answered her with the question we have all come to expect from him now, ‘Ghaliex le?’ I’ll put the rest of his reply in English, to save my having to translate for our international viewers: ‘If they were eating together, I hope it was a nice meal in an informal context. Can’t one person eat with another?’\\nApparently not, because when Sant’s stork-like sidekick Charlon Gouder found a years-old photograph of Jesmond Mugliett having dinner with the architect Robert Sant – who is now working on the infamous bridge – he stalked the prime minister with it in his hands for days. You have to hand it to Charlon: he’s a single-issue man. His obsessions verge on perversion.\\nSo let’s see now – why would the Lion of Change have been lunching a deux with Charles Polidano, one of the barons that Labour dislikes so much, saying that he gets whatever he wants from this government? Perhaps the Lion of Change was dispatched to secure a donation for his party’s coffers. We know that Labour are such bad financial managers that they’re always broke. They pay their people peanuts, and when I won a libel suit against them, and they had to pay me around Lm600 (Joseph Muscat was required to pay another Lm600), my lawyer ended up having to place a warrant of seizure on all their bank accounts – and still we just couldn’t find that Lm600. I had to call Jason Micallef and threaten to send in the bailiffs for Alfred Sant’s desk and computer and finally I got a cheque in the mail.\\nThat’s Labour for you. Then they want to tell this government how to make the economy grow by 4% (when it’s growing by 4% already – oh sorry, that was a misprint; we meant 6%).\\nWatch your tongue, Gunther Verheugen\\nGunther Verheugen put in an appearance in the 2003 general election, reminding us that what the Nationalist Party says about Europe isn’t spin but fact. It seems that the people of Malta won’t believe their own prime minister and must have outside confirmation. Needs must when the devil drives.\\nNow here’s Verheugen again, interviewed via satellite link for BondiPlus, telling us that what Sant says he’s going to do isn’t ‘legally possible’, and even if he were to attempt the impossible and try, he’s going to have to knock on 26 prime ministerial doors and make his case to each and every one of them. That’s something that has never happened before, Verheugen said.\\nSant wasn’t on the show to say that he’d bite off his long tongue, like he did last time, but his old friend Evarist Bartolo was, as slimy, snake-like and underhand as ever. And what is this problem that Labour people have with heckling the prime ministers they don’t agree with? My abiding memory of the 2003 general election is of Sant heckling Fenech Adami in that washerwoman’s voice he uses when he’s cross, even as the credits rolled in the last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign.\\nNow here was Evarist Bartolo, talking over the prime minister and interrupting him, not letting him say that the reason Malta is in the Eurozone in the first place is because Sant is wrong about Malta being in a financial mess. You can’t be in a financial mess when you enter the Eurozone. It’s not allowed. If Gonzi were of the washerwoman frame of mind, like Bartolo is despite pretending to be an intellectual like Sant, he might have said: ‘The Labour Party would know all about finances that are in a mess, wouldn’t it?’ But he’s not that kind of man, and that’s why people prefer him to The Other One.\\nGonzi coins a slogan for Labour\\n‘Aghzel Labour ghax ihammeg’ – a sort of reverse washing-powder, perhaps. Throw a dash of Labour in your washing-machine and your laundry comes out dirty and stinking.\\nI have a theory about Sant and the EU\\nHe keeps repeating that the referendum result counted for nothing in his book, that he has no regrets about his stance on EU membership, and that the only verdict he rates is the verdict in a general election.\\nNow he lists the various fights he intends to pick with the European Union. He also has one of those dreadfully incapacitating mindsets that allows for no revision of a fixed view. People miss this fact because on other matters, Sant chops and changes as he goes along, all in the interests of opportunism. But those are minor issues as far as he’s concerned. On his major, life-defining issue of EU membership for Malta, he hasn’t changed his tune for 40 years, and he isn’t going to.\\nSo, taking all these factors and clues into consideration, this is what he’s revving up to do. First he makes it plain that he’s still Eurosceptic and that he plans to ‘renegotiate’ with Europe. That way, we are forewarned of his intentions, and if we elect him prime minister, he will consider himself as having a mandate to press forward with his Eurosceptic approach and his attempts at renegotiation.\\nWhen his renegotiation attempts fail at the first hurdle, he’ll begin trying to pull us away from, and ultimately out of, the European Union. Because he doesn’t believe in referendums, but only in general elections, he won’t even ask us for our opinion. We can march and mass and protest in streets and squares as we did in the 1980s, and he’ll just ignore us and tell us that the result of a general election is what counts, and we voted for him to renegotiate with Europe.\\nGonzi keeps asking why there is nothing in Labour’s electoral programme about what they plan to do with the €855 million in funds that will come in from the EU. Well, that’s the reason why. Sant’s plan is to have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU, still less with its funds. It’s dirty money to him. Show him a bunch of euros, and he recoils. I haven’t heard him say the word ‘euro’ once in this entire campaign.\\nIf he has his way, there’ll be no funds to bother about because there’ll be no EU membership to bother about either.\\nHe still hasn’t forgiven us for voting Yes in that referendum. He really can’t stand us for doing it. He despises all those of us who are pro-European, and that’s another reason he despises university students – because they booed him for trying to keep them out of the EU. That’s why he’s turning this general election into a No vote for Europe and hoping that we’re fool enough not to notice.\\nEvarist the democrat\\nEvarist Bartolo said on BondiPlus that we shouldn’t be afraid Labour will take us out of Europe. With that expression of outraged honour that he likes to wear – when he’s not wearing the one that says ‘I’m an intellectual and you’re not’ – he turned to the prime minister and said: ‘At our party’s general conference in 2001, we decided that if people vote for EU membership in the 2003 general election, we will respect their decision.’\\nAr’hemm hej. Allahares le, as my grandmother would say. How did they structure the question for that vote, I wonder: will we or won’t we respect the people’s verdict in the 2003 general election? Then they vote to respect the people’s decision and applaud themselves for being democratic. What are these people, and which part of what deeply secluded jungle did they come from?\\nYou will notice that Bartolo made no mention of the referendum that lay up ahead when he and his party folk took that landmark vote for democracy at the 2001 general conference. The Iva/Le campaign was already up and running, but they were pretending that no referendum was going to happen. We forget just how bad Sant really is: while Malta was gearing up for a referendum vote, he was gearing up to pretend that it never happened (except for that brief moment when partnership won and he was drunk on a lorry with his tie askew, wondering what fate now held in store for him).\\nVAT on school ties and 5% off an atlas\\nI want to rush at the television screen and give that Evarist Bartolo a good shake when I hear him speaking about things that he can’t possibly believe in. The man wasn’t born without a brain, and he knows how to maximise his advantages. For example, he fought against EU membership in the trenches at his friend Sant’s side, but I knew he couldn’t possibly dislike the idea. Then, when his super-intelligent high-achieving daughter (a really smart girl) won a place at Cambridge, he was able to take advantage of EU membership and the fact that he doesn’t have to pay the crippling fees that apply to non-EU citizens.\\nYou have to hand it to Labour. They really know how to work the very system they pretended to fight against to keep the irascible Sant happy. Some of the party’s keenest front-line anti-EU fighters were the first to stick their noses into the European Commission trough.\\nSo why did I want to give Bartolo a good shake this time? It was when I heard him defend Sant’s nutty proposal about what he claims is VAT on education. Not only is there no VAT on education, but education itself is completely free for those who need it like that, paid for mainly out of other people’s taxes. How do you slap VAT on something for which you pay nothing?\\nThe Labour Party thinks very little of its supporters if it thinks they’ll swallow this. But apparently, some of them do. I watched Claudette Baldacchino interviewing them at a mass meeting the other week and they were all saying how good this measure will be because VAT on education is almost forcing them to go out and beg on the streets.\\nLou Bondi pointed out to Bartolo that the Labour Party defines ‘VAT on education’ as VAT on school ties, atlases, schoolbooks (the VAT on any sort of book is a measly 5%), computers, software, desks, stationery, pens, satchels, shoes, uniforms – with children, the list is endless. As Bondi remarked, what’s to stop parents buying assorted desks and pieces of furniture or computers for themselves, and then claiming them as educational items under Labour’s whacky policy?\\nBartolo wasn’t amused. He put on his expression of outraged honour again. How dare Bondi criticise Sant’s policy? ‘You’d better be careful,’ he warned him in that Labour voice, ‘or we’ll know for sure that what people say about you is true.’\\n‘What do people say about me that’s true?’ Bondi asked. And Bartolo replied, ‘They call your show GonziPlus.’ Oooooooh – harsh one, Ev. You really have to hand it to these Labour big cheeses: the ability to crack a good joke is not their strong point.\\nFor those of you who are curious about this Amazing Plan for VAT Off Education, this is how it works. Bartolo explained it. They’ll get into government and then they’ll see. Just like with the surcharge. And just like when they removed VAT and found themselves reinventing the tax wheel.\\nThey do have a vague outline, though: parents will collect all the receipts for every single pen, pencil, school tie, atlas and blank CD they buy. Then every couple of months they’ll send these mountains of receipts off to a special VAT-Off-Education Department, where a thousand little elves will be employed to sort through the thumbed and well-worn detritus and check each little stub carefully for cheating. Then they’ll them up, work out the VAT element in each total, check the parents’ details, and work out a VAT refund to be allocated along with the children’s allowance.\\nPractical, isn’t it? Just like all Labour’s stupid gimmicks, it doesn’t make sense (why are we not surprised, when the person who comes up with them doesn’t make any sense either?). Wouldn’t it be cheaper and cost far less in man-hours to just slap on a straightforward increase in the children’s allowance cheque?\\nAh, but no – that doesn’t have the right ring of a gimmick about it. VAT-Off-Education (when education is free) sounds a whole lot better than Vote for Us and Get Another €100 of children’s allowance every year. Telenovela Sant is at it again.\\nLabour strikes oil\\nI’m still waiting for the moment in this election campaign when Labour United produces a giant geological map and tells us that its secret oil-rigs have struck liquid gold.\\nUnder yet another tent, this time in Senglea, Sant gave us his word that he will strike oil when elected prime minister (‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’).\\nHe most certainly is hoping he will, because it’s the only chance he’s got of solving the problem he’s landed his party with before they’ve even got into government. Lino Spiteri must be wiping the sweat off his brow with relief that none of this is ever going to be his responsibility.\\nYou see, Sant is still sticking to his guns about halving the electricity surcharge for families (the European Commission won’t let him halve it for businesses, as that counts as state aid), even as the price of oil hit €103 a barrel in the last couple of days. When he first made his reckless commitment, oil cost €89 a barrel. In the mere course of this electoral campaign, the cost to the taxpayer of Sant’s opportunistic electioneering promise has soared by millions of euros.\\nWhere’s he going to get that money? Don’t look around the room, because there’s nobody else there but you.\\nBeing positive hurts them in the guts\\nThe prime minister and Evarist Bartolo were asked to give just one final sentence each to wrap up that edition of BondiPlus. Well, what do you know? Bartolo stuck to the grand old Labour tradition of manipulating negative sentiments. ‘If you have always voted PN and are fed up of this government, come to us. Vote Labour,’ he said.\\nClassy act, our Ev – he would use his last TVM comment before the general election to address the disgruntled Nationalist vote, instead of filling us with hope and inspiration at the wonders of a new Labour government.\\nCome over to the Dark Side. Darth Vader is waiting for you.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIf the Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando case was really that scandalous, then how come AD didn’t know anything about it? Carmel Cacopardo must have fallen asleep on the night-watch. Too bad Jo Said didn’t jump out at him from a bush to yell ‘Corruption!’ in his ear.\\nNow here comes Harry Vassallo, to join forces with his sole remaining potential coalition partner, Alfred Sant. Vassallo called this ‘the obscene Mistra case’. Go back to sleep, Vassallo – or to borrow a choice phrase from my youngest son, just eff off until you get your priorities right.\\nThis campaign has been littered with Labour’s hideous obscenities, and finally Vassallo wakes up from the land of nod and calls something obscene – only it’s not the way that Sant behaved in this case and others. Oh, no – it’s the way a third party put in an application for development on Pullicino Orlando’s land.\\nVassallo should have a little consultation with Cacopardo, a man who seriously needs to have his eyebrows trimmed because they’re taking over the whole show. Tenants apply to the MEPA for permission to develop their landlord’s property all the time. They are supposed to inform the landlord and seek his permission, but they don’t and the MEPA never checks. I live in a green area, all of it agricultural land which is owned by the Joint Office (church-government), and you can bet that when any one of the tenant-farmers wants to build a room for his tools or a rubble wall, dig a reservoir or an artesian well, or put down a cement road for his truck, it’s not the Joint Office that puts in the application. The Joint Office probably doesn’t even know what’s going on.\\nAnd this throws up some very interesting scenarios. Let’s say that when Alfred Sant is prime minister, somebody who pays rent to the Joint Office for a stretch of land decides to apply to the MEPA for permission to build an open-air nightclub or even a pizza parlour. The Joint Office is not informed. What are we expected to do, then – stand outside the Archbishop’s Curia and the Auberge de Castille to shout ‘korruzjoni’? Maybe Harry Vassallo will come out of the woodwork to call Archbishop Cremona and Prime Minister Sant ‘obscene’.\\nAD the watchdog\\nI can’t believe that the AD people are still at it, ranting on about coalitions until the 11th hour. Claire Bonello has colonised the Internet forums to tell people that a seat in a coalition government for AD is crucial because that way, AD can be the people’s watchdog.\\nWhat? The people’s watchdog when the people didn’t vote for AD? How presumptuous and self-important these people are. They don’t even begin to realise how arrogant they sound: 3000 people vote them in to parliament and suddenly they’re the nation’s watchdog. I don’t see Rita Law saying she’s the national watchdog just because she has more votes than AD.\\nBonello didn’t have a ready reply when somebody asked her, ‘In that case, if AD is going to watch the government, who is going to watch AD?’ Because all of its people are as pure as the driven snow, AD has the divine right to govern unchecked.\\nWell, I have news for you. Nobody’s perfect.\\nHarry the rent-law campaigner is a protected tenant\\nOn The Times Internet forum, I have been challenging AD for days to come forward with their much-trumpeted honesty and declare that none of its leading protagonists is a protected tenant. As soon as I post that kind of comment, AD’s input into the debate goes dead silent.\\nThey know that I know exactly which one of them is a protected tenant, and they also know why I’m asking. And like Alfred Sant, they’re too chicken to say, because it kind of undermines their relentless rent-law campaigning on behalf of landlords, if the news gets out that Saint Harry Vassallo is a protected tenant himself and won’t return the keys.\\nYes, he has offices in Valletta which he never uses because he hasn’t worked as a lawyer for years. The offices belong to somebody else and he pays a peppercorn rent every year. The owners have been asking him for a long time for the return of the keys and what’s rightfully theirs. They have to listen to Harry Vassallo rant on about the unfairness of our rent laws while knowing that he’s exploiting the system to suit himself.\\nWhen Vassallo began his rent law reform campaign, they thought their moment had come. Through their lawyer they asked Vassallo to be a gentleman, stand by what he preaches, and return their property to them. Vassallo’s response was a hysterical outburst in a telephone call to the lawyer, complete with lovely threats.\\nI am familiar with those hysterical outbursts because I have seen a few of them at MEPA public hearings. They’re one of the reasons why I think of Vassallo as a latter-day Savonarola – all that screeching denunciation of others. It’s just too much.\\nSo Harry Vassallo the campaigner for landlords is still a protected tenant. My husband wrote a letter about this to Malta Today, and because Malta Today appears to have become part of the MLPAD coalition, it wasn’t published. Never mind – his wife has a blog that’s had 9,500 hits in just 12 hours (and a newspaper column for good measure), so Harry’s little secret is out.\\nHe’s got a right to be a protected tenant\\nOf course he has. That’s exactly what he’s campaigning against: the fact that the law allows people like him to hang on to other people’s property, even when they’re not using it, while paying peanuts.\\nWhen this subject came up at a social gathering recently, an AD supporter defended him by saying, ‘Don’t blame Harry. Blame the law. As long as the law says he should keep it, then he can. That’s why he’s campaigning to change the law.’ Excuse me, but how does that work, exactly? The law allows Vassallo to keep the property, but it does not oblige him to do so. He is free to hand the keys back to the legal owner of the place, and because this is the main tenet of his rent law reform campaign, he should set an example immediately by doing so.\\nBut he doesn’t, because we’re all human. Savonarola has feet of clay, after all.\\nJason il-pilastru ta’ Sant\\nJason Micallef, armed with his vacuous smile even in the most serious of situations, and wearing the expression that says “Everything that goes in from my left ear comes straight out of my right’, huddles up to Sant rather too cosily. On Super One yesterday afternoon, when they sat behind that silly desk trying to explain to the nation why Sant walked out of the PBS studios to avoid nasty Jeffrey, they were shoved right up together, leaning in to each other with their shoulders touching. What purpose does Micallef serve, exactly – literally that of moral support? Would Sant have slid right under the desk without Micallef propping him up?\\nIf Sant feels the need to have a dog around, now that his poodle has been long gone in Brussels, he should get a real one. I can recommend Staffordshire bull terriers. They hug up against their owners and keep nasty journalists and angry MPs away. Oh, and they have a brain.\\nBatman and Robin visit Kennedy Grove\\nIn the final week of the electoral campaign, Batman and Robin are finding nothing better to do than trail around local beauty spots to tell us how malandati they are. First they went to Buskett. Now they’ve gone to Kennedy Grove.\\nI watched them wandering like a funeral procession around the scene of so many of my childhood picnics. It seemed like a violation. I’ll never be able to remember butterflies again. Now all I can think about when I see the Kennedy Memorial is those grim-faced crows.\\n‘What on earth are they doing trailing around Kennedy Grove in the last few days of the campaign, instead of explaining to us what they plan to do when in government?’ I muttered to myself on the sofa. Somebody overheard me. ‘Maybe they’ve run out of mud and have gone to pick up supplies,’ he said. ‘After 16 years of mudslinging, they must have run out.’\\nSomebody else chimed in – ‘Maybe Jason Micallef has been stealing his boss’s supply of mud to use as a face-pack.’ Well, I don’t know about that. He had very deep black circles round his eyes the last time I looked at him. Someone isn’t sleeping.\\nSant’s whistleblowers\\nAD has another rant to share with the MLP: the need for a Whistleblower Act. Sant has found a convenient excuse as to why he won’t release his remaining bits of ammunition, and it’s not that his machine-gun has malfunctioned.\\nHe can’t release this information, he said at his mass meeting, because the people who passed it on to him have changed their minds and said that they feel their livelihoods might be imperilled. Well, what can I say – at least it’s only their livelihoods and not their lives as it would have been when Sant was president of the MLP. Why do I think that this just sounds like a very convenient excuse?\\nIf Sant’s informants in the Pullicino Orlando case and others like them were really whistleblowers in the true sense of the word, they would not have waited until the 11th hour in an election campaign, when they sense that Sant will be the next prime minister, to blow their pathetic little whistles. All this tells me is that they’re trying to curry favour with the next administration and holding out for promotion and a little bit of favouritism. I give you this information and you give me a leg-up.\\nNo Whistleblower Act should ever be used to protect nasty specimens like this, who are only in it for what they can get out of it, and who are certainly not thinking of what’s right or of the national interest.\\nLabour – a slick and professional outfit\\nYou know how the Nationalist Party raised around €500,000 during a fund-raising marathon on NET TV the Saturday before last? Well, the Labour Party felt it had to go one better, and held a fund-raising marathon on Super One the next day. When I switched on the television to take a look late in the evening, the figure hovered at just over €100,000 and the hosts looked a bit down-in-the-mouth.\\nThey’d realised too late that they had made a serious misprint: holding a fund-raising marathon on television while their entire television audience was standing on the Floriana Granaries shouting and waving MLP flags. God, how I laughed: another misprint from Labour; another computer malfunction.\\nI bet it was Jason Micallef and the Lion of Change who dreamt that one up. I’d like to see them trying to slash the deficit to nothing and keep unemployment down if they can’t even work out something like this: that you don’t put on a television fund-raiser while all your donors are at the biggest mass meeting ever.\\nThen they tried to Tippex over this misprint by saying that the Labour Party is il-partit taz-zghir who can’t afford to give donations (and of course, the nasty government has taken all their money anyway) and not il-partit tal-baruni like Joe Saliba’s gang. Maybe the Nationalist Party just has common sense and strong organisational skills, and they don’t.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLast Wednesday, Anglu Farrugia – former inspector in Lorry Pullicino’s force force and shadow minister for justice – rushed down to Police Headquarters and shot the Labour Party in the foot.\\nYou may have wondered why Super One isn’t saying anything about il-kaz skandaluz ta’ korruzzjoni fahhxija fil-Freeport. Well, it’s because Farrugia isn’t the brightest bulb in Labour’s chandelier – and that’s saying something. He didn’t bother to check out the voting preference of the person in question, having assumed that anybody who has links with the Freeport must vote PN.\\nBut as Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando revealed last Saturday, that’s not the case at all. You can be two of Sant’s shadow ministers and have links to the Freeport. You can rent flats to the Freeport for years in the name of a company, then get your wife to sign the back of the rent-cheques and cash them at the bank instead of putting them through the company account. You can do this even during the 22 months when you are sitting in Sant’s cabinet.\\nBir-rispett kollu…ghaliex le? Then you can quickly make a spontaneous declaration to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, put your affairs in order, and allow Sant to say at a press conference that as far as he’s concerned, you’ve done nothing wrong.\\nWell, he would say that, wouldn’t he? Back in 1992, when he was already leader of the Labour Party, I was working as associate editor at The Malta Independent. A hot story came in: the Labour Party leader was the anonymous Malta correspondent of The Economist Intelligence Unit, and he wasn’t declaring his earnings from that source for income tax. We checked it out, found it was true, and ran the piece with comments from a leading tax consultant. Sant is sympathetic to his shadow ministers and their Freeport flats because he’s been in their position. If he were to chastise them, they would say, ‘You’re a fine one to talk, aren’t you?’\\nBut back to Anglu and the scandal that backfired\\nAnglu Farrugia told the Commissioner of Police that he knows of six people who were asked to pay between €2,700 and €2,400 to get a job at the Freeport. The former police inspector revealed with relish that he even knew the name of the person taking the backhanders: Simon Spiteri.\\nNow this is what I mean when I say that Farrugia isn’t the brightest bulb in the chandelier. Spiteri’s nickname is ‘it-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant’. What does that tell you about him? There, you see – even you could work it out, and I mean his political party of choice, rather than his supposed parentage.\\nSpiteri already has a record with the police on similar charges. A few weeks before Farrugia huffed down to his former place of work to file his report, Michael ‘Opus Dei’ Axiaq of the Nationalist Party had filed a similar report about Spiteri, involving other people whose money he had taken.\\nI don’t wish to repeat that bit about Farrugia’s brightness, but it should have been obvious to him that (1) Spiteri’s nickname says a lot about his voting tendencies and (2) he wasn’t taking the money in return for giving jobs at the Freeport, but taking the money and running. After I sat and mulled over this one a little – how on earth does Farrugia imagine that the Freeport human resources division relies on thugs taking money for its recruitment? –something clicked. Of course Farrugia believes this kind of thing happens, because that’s the way it happened in his day under Labour. He probably thinks that it’s still par for the course.\\nFarrugia wasn’t the only one who thought he had scooped a scandal\\nA few weeks back, Labour MP Karl Chircop and shadow tourism minister Evarist Bartolo spoke about cases they knew of in which people were asked to pay money to get a job at the Freeport. They flung their accusations around – Sant taught them well – but refused to give the Commissioner of Police any further details when he asked to have them. There was an embarrassing scene on television with, if I remember rightly, Karl Chircop, in which the interviewer pressed him to explain why he refused to tell the Commissioner of Police who was taking money from people and telling them he could get them a job at the Freeport.\\nAh, now we know why he wouldn’t tell. Unlike Anglu Farrugia, he knows the significance of the nickname ‘it-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant’. I can’t imagine that a news clip which begins ‘Simon Spiteri, maghruf bhala t-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant, huwa akkuzat li ha flus minghand in-nies….’ would serve any possible electoral purpose for the Labour Party.\\nSome people will believe anything\\nWith the Labour administration of 1971 to 1987, corruption was so rampant that there are still people around who think they can bribe their way to whatever they want or need. But really, how disengaged from reality do you have to be to hand money over to somebody who claims to be a Freeport go-between, and who promises to get you a job in return?\\nI suppose you have to be somebody like Anglu Farrugia. The gist of his police report wasn’t that there was a swindler about, taking money off people by making false promises. No, the gist of his report was that a certain individual was taking money in return for Freeport jobs.\\nSome minister of justice he’ll make.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn a bid at salvaging what’s left of his credibility, Alfred Sant raced down to Police Headquarters accompanied by the glossy Jason, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion. They all looked whey-faced. Sant looked as though the worms in his cheese had eaten his toast.\\nThey were there to meet the man that Sant so memorably described on television as a paraventu ghall-korruzzjoni. I wonder how that went. Let’s picture the scene. Sant walks in with his delegation of four for moral support – we all know he’s a coward – and the inscrutable police commissioner politely avoids the subject of paraventi. Sant doesn’t bring it up to apologise (he has no regrets). The police commissioner offers them a ‘kafe jew tnejn’ and they get down to business. The Lion of Change brings out his lucky santa tal-Madonna and kisses it. Jason fixes his hair and smiles at the handsome police officer by the door. DNA Mangion does a quick mental reckoning of how much the latest batch of flats will bring in.\\nThe Police Commissioner tries hard not to sneak a look at his watch. Privately he might be thinking that if anyone knows about land deals, it’s DNA Mangion. He says nothing, of course.\\nIs a third-party application for construction on land owned by an MP a police matter? Of course it isn’t. It’s a matter for the MEPA auditor. The police only get involved where there are issues of criminality – fraud, bribery, the exchange of money for favours. The Police Commissioner must be very annoyed to see that the man who described him as a paraventu is the very one who is trying to use him as such. By rushing off to file a report with the police, Sant hopes to give us the impression that there is criminality involved. He knows that some people are gullible, and he knows that the police commissioner would never tell him over the telephone, ‘Look here, sir – there are no criminal aspects to this case. Take it elsewhere.’\\nI don’t like the fact that the prime minister referred the case to the police. He’s a lawyer, so he knows that there’s no criminal case involved. By reporting it to the police after he had already reported it to the MEPA auditor, he was just embroiling himself in Sant’s weasel game.\\nSo the wig met the paraventu and got his photo-op outside Police HQ. I’ve just sat through the painful coverage on One News, which is making much of it so as to drown out the sound of mocking laughter and shouts of ‘U-turn ohra!’ and ‘Mela he’s not a paraventu now?’\\nFrom Police HQ, Sant and the other three legs of this particular table went to stand on the steps of the Auberge de Castille in a dress rehearsal for the Big Day. After all, it’s just a short drive from Floriana and oil is only $103 a barrel. The Super One reporter who accompanied this farcical delegation held a reverential microphone to Sant’s lips (‘tmissnix jekk joghgbok’) and asked him why he had done that morning’s brave deed.\\n‘It’s because we are honest and clean,’ he said, while DNA Mangion cast about frantically in his mind for any more rented flats or similar difficulties. The Lion of Change worried briefly about the fact that he hadn’t raised his hand when the boss asked a coffee-morning crowd amusingly whether any of them had a swimming-pool to take advantage of his halved surcharge. After all, he has a fairly nice one at home in L-Iklin, but he would have felt like a prat as the only one with his hand in the air in front of the TVM, Super One and NET cameras.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nBuy the T-shirt at Labour HQ, Mile End\\nSo guess what Alfred Sant did today. He went on a ‘mini tour tal-korruzzjoni’ with the Three Stooges. I am not joking – that’s what he called it. And no, it wasn’t organised by Norman Hamilton Tours, either.\\nThey were in a bit of a hurry, so they scheduled only five stops: the docks (where a journalist reminded him about what happened the last time he raised the subject), the Regional Road bridge (where another journalist asked him whether the next stop would be Birzebbugia, to talk about DNA Mangion’s Freeport flats), and the Transport Authority’s offices (where a journalist asked him whether they would also be going to the airport to talk about the Labour Party’s business delegation to Dubai).\\nYou’re right. You only counted three stops there, not five. That’s because Sant told his press entourage that there wasn’t enough time to make the other two stops – to the MEPA (what a surprise) and to the Ta’ Qali Crafts Village. There’s corruption at the Ta’ Qali Crafts Village? Apparently not – he was only going to drag the press there to talk about asphalting that had never been done. Now that’s a really serious problem. The government should have put the deficit and the Eurozone on hold, and seen to it first.\\nThere was a similar Corruption Tour in the 1996 electoral campaign, but it was much, much busier. They spoke about bus-ticketing machines and barunijiet, paraventi and hbieb tal-hbieb, piling scandal upon scandal. Sant is probably hoping to repeat that success by using the same strategy. In that campaign, people were so focussed on their desire for Schadenfreude, and so impressed by the modern man in his two-sizes-too-large jacket (or is it just that he has unnaturally short arms?) that they never stopped to ask him what he would do once he got into government.\\nHow was he planning to run the country – by shouting abuse from his office window at the Auberge de Castille? To our great horror, we found out that the answer to this question – the one almost nobody asked – was yes. He carried on behaving in government exactly as he had been behaving in Opposition, shouting about hofor and corruption and scaring the bejeezus out of every investor who had half a thought of coming here to set up shop. And all we got was a hofra that grew by the day and soaring unemployment.\\nBring it on. We’re waiting.\\nChicken Run Sant and his Three Stooges have just two days of campaigning to go. If they don’t use them to tell us what in heaven’s name they plan to do when in government – except wreak chaos, that is – we are never going to find out until it’s too late.\\nThe closer we get to the day, the more ridiculous their stunts and gimmicky campaigning become. And everywhere they go, they look like a funeral procession trailing gloom and doom in their wake. They’re like a bunch of gangster extras from Pulp Fiction – the ones that were left on the shelf just in case the real actors called in sick. Three of them look about as light-hearted as circling vultures, and the other one splits his face into a look-at-me smile every time he sees a camera.\\nChicken Run Sant and his winning team in the winning bus\\nWell I must say, they’re very confident, aren’t they? This week, the kowc tal-bidla has become the kowc tar-rebha. And with all those morose and glowering vultures on board, it isn’t the most inspiring sight.\\nSant is turned on by corruption\\nThe only time we ever see him animated is when he’s talking about corruption. Then he gets really excited. His dead-fish eyes light up. His face comes alive. His body actually moves like that of a normal person, instead of the usual lower half of one arm jerking oddly from the elbow, with the trunk of the body and the shoulders rigid as though held fast in a full-body cast. And please don’t get me started on the hands. Each time he holds up his right hand in that palm-upward, thumb and forefinger gesture, the only thing I can think of is how unusually small and neat it is for a man’s. Girly hands on a man give me the heeby-jeebies.\\nI used to think that Chicken Run Sant had an obsession with corruption. Now I think it’s a fetish. At the merest trigger of a suggestion, he becomes lost in a reverie of kafe jew tnejn, dud fil-gobon, networks tal-hbieb (‘this is the trouble with corruption; they cover up their tracks’). It’s an oft-repeated and well-rehearsed spiel, and it’s now verging on a sick obsession. I can actually see his mind spinning through the plots. It’s the thwarted novelist in him. Chicken Run Sant is out to get Them, but if They confront him, he runs away to the warm safety of Jason and the Super One studio.\\nSant goes back to the studio after first checking the premises for signs of Jeffrey\\nThe sight of Chicken Run Sant being turned on by talk of corruption was the (poor) highlight of his Broadcasting Authority ‘press conference’ (for it is anything but) which was televised earlier tonight. This was the one that had to be rescheduled after he fled in his getaway Mazda at the sight of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando in the recording studio.\\nThe only time we saw him come alive in that dead show was when he found an opening to start banging on about corruption and how They cover Their tracks. Who are These people? Well, we don’t know, do we, because Chicken Run Sant isn’t telling. His latest excuse is that he’s waiting for the Whistleblower Act to protect his sources. Why doesn’t he wait until he becomes prime minister and promote them instead? After all, that’s probably what they had in mind when they passed on their hot tips.\\nThat nice, sensible journalist from Il-Gens asked him how long he’d had his ammunition, but Sant wasn’t telling. ‘It doesn’t matter how long I’ve had it,’ he said. Translated, this means he’s had it for a long time, but doesn’t want to say so because he knows it makes him look like an opportunist out to win an election by any means, rather than somebody who genuinely has the national interest at heart.\\nThe nice journalist pressed home his point (nicely): ‘But do you think it’s the right thing to do, making all these accusations in the last week of the campaign, when the people you are targeting don’t have the right opportunity to counter your claims, and when the people who are voting don’t have the time to weigh up the situation properly?’ Chicken Run Sant wouldn’t budge. Instead he took this as the cue for more excited talk about corruption.\\nThat no-nonsense Amanda from the Nationalist Party press pointed out that he hadn’t called a press conference, published a book in the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti or reported the matter to the Paraventu Commissioner (my words, not hers) when he was prime minister and his personal assistant – that man who looks like an unemployed waiter, Joe Borg – was found to have been building a ‘farmhouse’ without a permit in a rural area. Sant performed his party trick and blanked her completely, taking her question as yet another cue to thrill to the excitement of corruption under a Nationalist government.\\nAmanda wasn’t having any of that. She asked him what he planned to do about his shadow minister of finance (and the other one) who had been found not to have declared earnings from flats rented to the Freeport, at a time when both of them were in Sant’s cabinet.\\nSo if Chicken Run Sant becomes prime minister, we’re going to have a minister of justice who was a police inspector in the early 1980s under Lorry Pullicino, and a finance minister who sent his wife to cash his rent-cheques and failed to declare the income. And then Sant has the nerve to scream and shout about the failings of others.\\nThe spiel about the reception class changes yet again\\nFirst they said it would mean an extra year in school, and all the kids would leave at 17. Then they said it would apply to all schools – state, church, and independent – because of the national curriculum. Then they justified it by saying it was based on the British system. Then when it was pointed out to them that our system is already the British system because it was set up by the British, and that British children leave compulsory schooling at 16, they changed the story again. Compulsory schooling wouldn’t end at 17, but at 16. But it does so already, we said, and scratched our heads.\\nSo where was that extra year going to be squashed in, then? Perhaps they’ve teamed up with Paul Vincenti and Gift of Life to teach three terms in the womb – nine months is just perfect.\\nIn his BA press conference tonight, Sant tried to clear up the mystery by adding to it. He actually answered one question, and it was about this. A year is not necessarily a year, he said. It could be three months. Or it could be a year. And it could be after kindergarten, or before primary, and you know how some children are born in January and others are born in September (yes, Alfred, we did know that), well that’s what he means and that explains it then.\\nThe nice journalist from Il-Gens, who asked the question, looked as though he had been pinned to the wall by a Scientologist intent on explaining to him how alien beings can spy on his thoughts if he doesn’t wear a tin-foil hat.\\nAnd none of us are any the wiser. It looks like this repeater class is going to be a rerun of the tax nightmare of ’96.\\nA comment posted on this blog, which deserves further attention\\n“I notice that many people believe that Alfred Sant’s behaviour at the BA press conference was acceptable. Maybe that is why he believes he can behave in such a manner with impunity.\\nPeople who think Sant’s behaviour is acceptable are not familiar with the internationally accepted protocols of press conferences. I have attended several and have never seen a situation where any prospective speaker asked for the removal of a member of the audience and called for the police to ensure that it happens, much less a speaker who is a would-be and has-been prime minister.\\nThere have been many occasions when speakers at press conferences faced a challenging audience, knowing their every move and word would be broadcast around the world. That is exactly what they did. They faced their audience and they took their questions. They didn’t split hairs over whether those questioners had a right to be in the room; they didn’t call for the police to remove the people they didn’t like, and they didn’t evoke the letter of the law to back up their presumption that they do not need to respond to questioners they don’t like.\\nIt matters little who mentioned the police first in this row. What matters is that would-be Prime Minister Sant expects the police to help him silence an opponent.\\nIt is sinister that institutions set up to ensure free and fair information fail in their mission because of pressure from a would-be prime minister.” – Corinne Vella\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLet us all pause for a while and remember the historic day in 1996 when Alfred Sant took a break between corruption tours and mud-slinging and went to a supermarket before the election. He made his xirja, came back, and told us in a shocked press conference how much it cost. I watched him on television unpacking his qoffa and discussing the prices of items, and all I could think of was Gloria Mizzi on TVM in my childhood, doing pretty much the same thing but so much more attractively.\\nAnd of course, he drove to the supermarket in his getaway Mazda, paid for by the tax-payer as is the Leader of the Opposition’s privilege.\\nThat xirja stunt helped him become prime minister. And when he became prime minister, the cost of his xirja rocketed within just a few months – thanks to his introduction of 33 new taxes, water and electricity bills that were higher than they are now, surcharge and all, at a time when oil cost just $12 a barrel (it now costs $103) and his punitive and tortuous replacement of VAT with CET.\\nWatch this clip for some amusing memories of Sant and his qoffa. Remember, this was the man who captured the imagination of enough people to make him prime minister then. There’s really no accounting for taste. It’s hard to believe that he’s still around, and still trying to pull the same kind of stunts.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWe have our first libel suit, and what a surprise – it’s from Michael Falzon, the studious kid who was never allowed out into the street to play with all the rest of us hamalli children who lived on the block. Michael and his brother Silvio would spend their free time studying hard in the grocer’s shop owned by their rabidly Mintoffjan father, who was determined that his kids would grow up to be better than the tal-pepe kids rolling around like peasants in the gutter and chasing each other with stones. If you want some insight into what makes Michael Falzon so obsessively driven in that ‘I’ve got it in for you all and I’m going to get to the top to get my revenge’ way, I’m the one who has it.\\nMichael would sit there listening to his father praise Dom Mintoff to his tal-pepe clientele when they popped round every afternoon to collect their hobza and ‘ration’. This was in Stella Maris Parish, the most chi-chi part of Sliema – so you can imagine that it didn’t make him the most popular grocer around. And neither did it do anything to help Michael integrate into the street-gangs that were de rigeur and which included all sorts, including a lovely boy called Etienne who suffered from a wasting disease and who let us hitch fast and dangerous rides down the hill on the back of his wheelchair.\\nMy mother would come home and say, ‘Look at Michael and Silvio – they’re always studying and doing their homework, and you’re always fighting in the street or running around somewhere.’ Now I tell her, ‘You were right, ma –had I been a good girl and studied harder, jahasra, I might have ended up deputy leader of the Labour Party.’\\nApparently, Michael Falzon is not bisexual. Well, I don’t think any of us ever had any doubts about that. Bring it on, Michael ta’ Muse – I’m going to love every minute of this one.\\nAnd here’s a link to one of his best performances yet:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kiZ6qKKat4\\nThe Lion of Change has a fertility thermometer\\nMichael Falzon went down to Hal-Qormi yesterday to have another good shout: ‘It-termometru qed jimmarka Lejber!’ If anyone has the clip, please send it to me immediately. I’m sure you’re generous enough to share it with others.\\nMaybe he was seeing the red dot at the end.\\nIt looks like this man’s ambition is to elbow his boss out of the way and become party leader himself. I trust that the alarm-bells are ringing already at the Glass HQ. Falzon, as if you hadn’t noticed already, models himself on Dom Mintoff, with all his vulgarity and crassness and few of the brains.\\nIf Sant loses this election, he’s definitely got to be put out to pasture. And for the sake of us all, the Labour Party has to choose a decent, stable and acceptable leader, preferably somebody with a normal home background, instead of yet another ghazeb or weirdo without a wife in the picture. You may think that this is an unimportant detail, but all you have to do is consider how important a part of Lawrence Gonzi’s arsenal Kate is, and you will see what I mean.\\nLet’s put it this way. If Labour had been sensible enough to pick somebody like George Abela, instead of the current fright-show, we wouldn’t be in this constant state of tension today. Imagine it and sigh with regret: a straight contest between George Abela and Lawrence Gonzi, two men with remarkably similar profiles and images, two sound, solid and regular guys. It would have been bliss compared to this nightmare fight-to-the-death between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nMy sister Corinne Vella (the 42-year-old who Maltastar.com described as a ‘young student’ whom I had brought along to help me rabble-rouse at the university debate) posted this comment further along. It’s addressed to Victor Laiviera, a personal friend of Alfred Sant who has taken it upon himself to defend him all over the Internet. I don’t want you to miss it, so I’m posting it here.\\nCorinne is too self-effacing to spell it out herself, but her perspective on the matter is probably one of the most relevant that anyone living here in Malta can give. For the last few years she has worked in the press centre of every single major World Economic Forum Meeting in various parts of the globe, including the January meeting for world leaders in Davos. The press conferences which she helps organize, and for which she is present, are not the sterile and meaningless ‘press conferences’ organized by the Broadcasting Authority, featuring Alfred Sant and a selection of journalists bearing state-approved cards from the government’s Department of Information, but massive events crowded with the world’s top media – CNN, BBC, The New York Times, the London broadsheets, and hundreds of others – and the person being grilled under the spotlight of several television cameras is a world political or business leader. And because Alfred Sant and his friend Frans Sammut, who wrote a hagiography about him in which photocopies of his Harvard certificates were included as colour plates, value these such things far more than experience and ability, I should point out to them that she also holds a postgraduate degree in communications from the London School of Economics.\\nOn this matter, as on others, her opinion is worth a whole lot more than Victor Laiviera’s, friend of Sant.\\nIn my last two posts I mentioned my experience of attending several international press conferences. I did so because it underpins what I have to say on this matter, not to score points over Victor Laiviera, as he seems to think.\\nI stand by what I said. It is NOT acceptable under any circumstance for a speaker at a press conference to ask for a person to be evicted from the room. The only time this is acceptable is when that person poses a security risk. A threat to life and limb is a security risk. A challenge to accusations of corruption is not. There are no two ways about this. I did not mention this exception earlier as I took it to be self-evident. Given Mr Laiviera’s obstinacy, it appears I was wrong.\\nVictor Laiviera, as others do, keeps arguing about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando when the spotlight is shining the other way. If Alfred Sant gets his way, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando will be out of the political scene and Alfred Sant will be Prime Minister. That is why Sant’s behaviour is the central issue in this dispute. To Sant’s fans, his behaviour is heroic. To others it is sinister. Perhaps even Sant’s fans know this: their only defence of Sant in this matter is to say that his political opponent was in the wrong.\\nIt was Sant’s behaviour, and not Pullicino Orlando’s presence, that disrupted the press conference. Sant the would-be Prime Minister believes it is his prerogative to decide who can say what and when. That is a dangerous belief that Sant’s fans would have us all sanction.\\nIt is, was, and should remain the moderator’s prerogative and responsibility—and not the speaker’s—to manage a press conference. Alfred Sant knows this, which is why he normally moderates his own press conferences, an arrangement that enables him to ignore questioners he does not like.\\nIn the many international press conferences I have attended, there have been several occasions when members of the audience included people who are not journalists.\\nMany times the open hostility between speakers and people in the audience was known and visible beforehand.\\nOn several occasions, speakers faced questions that caused them great discomfort and embarrassment during press conferences that were being broadcast live on global TV networks.\\nThere have been numerous occasions when a journalist’s existence—not mere presence in the press conference room—was considered by a speaker to be a personal affront and abomination.\\nI could extend that list, but that will do for now.\\nNEVER in any of the situations I mention did any speaker refuse to take to the podium unless a member of the audience was first evicted, particularly not under police escort. And if any such request had been made, the press conference host, not just the moderator, would have refused to comply.\\nYou see, when the world’s media are watching, a sensible speaker faces with good grace any challenging question, however hostile, rather than refusing to take any questions at all.\\nAnd here, in tiny Malta, with only the local media watching, would-be and has-been Prime Minister Sant could not face up to a political opponent and so he asked for him to be removed under police escort.\\nEvidently Sant thinks that it is normal and acceptable to silence opponents. Otherwise, camera savvy as he is, he would not have called for the person’s removal under police escort while the local TV cameras filmed his every gesture and word.\\n– Corinne Vella\\nThese are not from my Little Red Book\\nThe penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men – Plato\\nThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing – Edmund Burke\\nIf a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be – Thomas Jefferson\\n  \\n\\n  \\nPretty-boy Jason took to the studio at Super One to announce that those involved in the production of the very interesting Miriam Dalli/Maria Muscat/Charlon Gouder video on YouTube would be made to pay. Even as he spoke, Labour’s lions of change were hunting them down.\\nQuite frankly, I’m sure Michael Falzon would prefer to spend his time munching on half an elephant while letting off fireworks and kissing his lucky santa tal-Madonna, in between bouts of floating about in his surcharged swimming-pool while chatting on the mobajl to Natalie, but never mind. Let him hunt.\\nThe point here, my dear ‘Robin’, is not who produced the video, who uploaded it, or who disseminated it, but whether what’s in it is true. And Jason had nothing to say about that.\\nSo if it’s untrue then it’s libellous and you can do your impossible best to find out who did it and sue. But if it’s true – well, I’m sorry folks, but you’ve just discovered the meaning of the Biblical phrase that he who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind.\\nMiriam Dalli is head of One News, after all – a television show that has nothing to do with news and everything to do with lies, cheating, persecution of the innocent, mud-slinging, hoodwinking the gullible, and a thousand other acts of despicable behaviour. She’s a beautiful woman and she’s fairly smart. In her position, a better person would have taken advantage of those assets and deployed them to great effect in the private sector, not taken God’s gifts and used them to mop the floor of the urinals at a Hells’ Angels meeting, so to speak. Imagine if the individuals involved in these cases had been the head of Net News and a Nationalist Party reporter. Super One would have rammed the subject down our throats over an entire month, but Net hasn’t said a word about this, and that’s the difference between the two political parties.\\nIt’s interesting, though, to see that Labour’s reaction to this taste of their own medicine (except that it’s not really a taste of their own medicine, because we have been given to understand that the facts in the video are correct, while Labour prefers lies), is to hunt down the perpetrator using the giant party machine and exact revenge. Typical Labour – old Labour, new Labour, they’re all the same. Clean out your house. You really need it.\\nStudents boo Sant; Sant sends in his tanks. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando challenges Sant; Sant calls the police. A video goes on YouTube showing the alleged extra-curricular activities of Charlon Gouder, Miriam Dalli and Maria Muscat, and Jason Micallef goes on television to promise revenge on those responsible. Those responsible, Jason? Why don’t you take a look around your own studio?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nChicken Run Sant ran for shelter yesterday evening to a tent in Qormi and stood behind a business-breakfast podium to speak to a crowd of… better not say it.\\nHe was safe and secure in the knowledge that here he was among admiring eyes who think of him as superior, after having seen the 1979 Harvard certificate that his friend Frans Sammut so kindly reproduced in his award-winning best-seller, ‘Alfred Sant: Vizjoni ta’ Bidla’ (Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti).\\nJason and the Lion of Change having already frisked the gentlemen and searched the ladies’ handbags for the presence of a serious security threat called Jeffrey, the Cowardly Custard felt it was safe to proceed. Having fled to the Crosscraft set in the PBS studios when confronted by an angry dentist who is perfectly qualified to carry out the threat (which he didn’t make) ‘naqlaghlek snienek’, he now felt safe to say what was on his mind.\\nAnd this is what he said: he will only confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando in court and with his lawyer present. Funny, but I thought that his lawyer was present in the studio that day. I thought his lawyer is always stuck to his right hip. Isn’t Michael Falzon a lawyer? Yes, that’s right – he’s a lawyer who is employed by Bank of Valletta plc. He seems to have saved up quite a lot of vacation leave, or maybe he’s just taking unpaid leave. He would always do the right thing, of course. The deputy leader of the Labour Party would never sink to the level of the disgusting Nationalists and abuse of his position.\\n‘He expected to have an exchange of views with me, imma jien ma nitkellimx ma’ nies bhalu,’ Chicken Run Sant said. I apologise for using the vernacular, but it’s the only thing that seems appropriate here: ar’hemm, hej. Zutt! If they lived 200 years ago, Pullicino Orlando might have challenged Sant to a duel at dawn and our feathered friend would have run clucking away.\\nSo let’s disabuse Big Bird of the notion that he needn’t engage in any exchange with Pullicino Orlando ever again. After this election, they’re both still going to be MPs, whichever side of the house they’re sitting on. In parliament, Sant can’t refuse to answer Pullicino Orlando’s questions. He is obliged to answer them. He forgets that Pullicino Orlando is neither a journalist who can be ignored nor a student who can be harassed.\\n‘Then what did he do? He went on television and cried,’ Henrietta the Hen said in a sarcastic voice. The crowd in his wigwam jeered. Labour – the party of unpleasantness. No wonder they end up with such ghastly leaders.\\nMichael Falzon lets off fireworks\\nBesides hunting in Romania, the Lion of Change (OK, I know it’s the lioness who hunts while the male sleeps, but if I call him a woman he’ll sue me again) has another hobby. ‘I have a licence to let off fireworks,’ he proudly told his interviewer.\\nThe feast of Stella Maris parish in Sliema must be the most low-key festa in the entire Maltese calendar. The sorts of people who live in that neighbourhood are not the kind to follow the vara up the street and get drunk in the local hanut tat-te (there aren’t any).\\nBut Falzon loves it, and he probably keeps it going singlehandedly, even though he now lives, famously, with a swimming-pool in L-Iklin (thank God for his feathered friend’s promise to halve the surcharge – you can really struggle on a BOV salary). I might be wrong, but he’s probably the only one behind that vara in August.\\nAs he explained to his interviewer, he loves brass bands and fireworks. Along with hunting and santi tal-Madonna, these are his hobbies (and writing poy-ims, too).\\nSo then I wondered whether this passion of his has anything to do with the fact that when the kowc tal-bidla – sorry, kowc tar-rebha – arrives in town, the cross vultures on board are greeted with loud, bright suffarelli.\\nIt’s against the law to let them off in public like that, and there are always policemen around – but hell, what’s a little bit of law-breaking when you’re trying to set an example?\\nThe Lion of Change is an intellectual\\nMichael Falzon told a recent interviewer that he writes poetry. You could picture her eyebrows going up, because he said, ‘Yes, really.’\\nThen one of the radio stations (I forget which, but it was probably Super One) broadcast one of his poy-ims. Here it is.\\nMorna fin-nort;\\nMorna fis-sawt.\\nMorna fl-east;\\nMorna fil-west.\\nLejber is de best.\\nSome interesting passages from ‘The Moral Basis of a Backward Society’\\nThe political scientist Edward C. Banfield wrote The Moral Basis of a Backward Society in 1958. He describes the people of a town in southern Italy, with emphasis on their political and social behaviour, showing how they were reluctant to cooperate or to maintain any kind of continuing relationship beyond those of the nuclear family.\\nBanfield argued that the people he studied behaved at all times as if they were following a rule which he called amoral familism, the guiding principle of which was to maximize the material gains and short-run advantage of the nuclear family, assuming always that all others will do the same. Those with no families he described as following a principle called amoral individualism.\\nBecause of its relevance to Malta in 2008, I thought you might be interested in some passages from this study of southern Italy 50 years ago.\\n“The amoral familist who is an office-holder will take bribes when he can get away with it. But whether he takes bribes or not, it will be assumed by the society of amoral familists that he does.”\\n“In a society of amoral familists, the claim of any person or institution to be inspired by zeal for public rather than private advantage will be regarded as fraud.”\\n“The amoral familist will use his ballot to secure the greatest material gain in the short run. Although he may have decided views as to his long-run interest, his class interest, or the public interest, these will not affect his vote if the family’s short-run, material advantage is in any way involved.”\\n“The amoral familist will value gains accruing to the community only insofar as he and his are likely to share them. In fact, he will vote against measures which will help the community without helping him because, even though his position is unchanged in absolute terms, he considers himself worse off if his neighbours’ position changes for the better. Thus it may happen that measures which are of decided general benefit will provoke a protest vote from those who feel that they have not shared in them or have not shared in them sufficiently. In 1954, the Christian Democrat Party showed the voters of Basso that vast sums had been spent on local public works. Nevertheless, the vote went to the Communists. …It seems likely that the very effectiveness of the Christian Democratic propaganda may have helped to cause its defeat. Seeing what vast sums had been expended, the voters asked themselves: Who got it all? Why didn’t they give me my fair share? No amoral familist ever gets what he regards as his fair share.”\\n“In a society of amoral familists, the voter will place little confidence in the promises of the parties. He will be apt to use his ballot to pay for favours already received (assuming, of course, that more are in prospect) rather than for favours which are merely promised….The principle of paying for favours received rather than for ones merely promised gives a great advantage to the party in power, of course. In effect, however, it is often more than offset by another principle, as follows. In a society of amoral familists, it will be assumed that whatever group is in power is self-serving and corrupt. Hardly will an election be over before the voters will conclude that the new officials are enriching themselves at their expense and that they have no intention of keeping the promises they have made. Consequently, the self-serving voter will use his ballot to pay the incumbents not for benefits but for injuries, i.e. he will use it to administer punishment. Even though he has more to gain from this party than from any other, the voter will punish a party if he is confident that it will be elected despite his vote. The ballot being secret, he can indulge his taste for revenge (or justice) without incurring losses.”\\nAmen. It looks like we haven’t travelled very far in the last half a century: using our vote to teach the party in government a lesson but hoping it will be elected all the same, sulking because we haven’t got our fair share (and as Banfield points out, people like this never do get their fair share, no matter how much they get), keeping an eye on what the others are getting so that we can use our vote to break off their connections. Yes, yes, yes – but Banfield was writing about a hick town in southern Italy in 1958 – and here we are, still thinking and behaving the same way.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nYou really have to watch this video. Turn the volume RIGHT up.\\nHarry Vassallo and the prison sentence\\nThere is something not quite right about this story, so I am not going into detail until we do have the details.\\nYet these are my immediate observations. The government had nothing to do with it, because with the separation of powers, the government can’t influence the decisions or workings of the courts. It was not the government that converted the fine to a prison sentence. It was the courts.\\nSo why did the police turn up to arrest him today when the fine was converted to a prison sentence as far back as October? These are precisely the details we need. In my understanding of these situations, when the police turn up to take you to prison, they give you just enough time to pack your bag. They do not allow you to call a press conference, go home to your wife and kids and decide what comes next.\\nWe need a statement from the Commissioner of Police, and we need to see those court papers.\\nIt appears that this process has been on-going for years, and that the case, or so we were told at the press conference, was decided months ago. Why, then, did Harry Vassallo say nothing about it? He should have been the first to let his supporters know, instead of letting them find out in this manner. Instead, he kept it quiet and even more quietly made his plea for a presidential pardon. He did so even as AD and its activists were raising hell about the plea for a presidential pardon put in by a clerk at the Transport Authority, who had taken a bribe.\\nI’m sorry to have to point it out at this delicate juncture, but this is along the same lines as Vassallo campaigning for the rights of landlords versus protected tenants when he is a protected tenant himself and refuses to hand the property back to the owners. When he realised that my husband knew about it, as the lawyer for the landlord, he rang him, shouted insults and threatened him with all manner of verbal abuse not to go public with it. My husband is not the kind of man who likes to go public with things, and it had never occurred to him. But Vassallo, of course, was concerned about me.\\nMy first reaction when I read the story was oh God, oh no, I can’t believe this is happening. His poor wife, I said; his poor kids. I even had lots of sympathy for him. We all make messes in our lives; it’s how we handle them that counts. But then I said, for heaven’s sake – if the shopkeeper down the road were to find himself in the same situation, what would we say about it? We would say that he should have put his affairs in order and not let things reach that messy stage. The VAT department is actually not that draconian. Its aim is to collect revenue, not to put people in prison. It would rather have the money than somebody in jail. People are regularly fined for not filling in VAT returns. They somehow get the money together and pay, or they cope with the consequences as best they can.\\nThe thing about Harry Vassallo is that he thinks of himself as a common man with uncommon advantages. Where it suits him, he is the common man – hanging onto the protected tenancy of a place that lies empty, failing to keep his affairs in order, applying for a presidential pardon. And then where it suits him, he exercises his uncommon advantages – expecting to neither pay a fine nor serve a prison sentence, calling a press conference to protest against something that very many others have endured but blamed only their own muddling inefficiency for.\\nVassallo kept the whole process secret for all these years – it does take years – so then why didn’t he keep this last stage secret too? Why didn’t he go to his extended family for help, pay the fine and move on, perhaps trying to find ways to pay back his dues? Please don’t tell me that his siblings and in-laws would rather see him go to prison than help him pay the fine.\\nHe had another choice: to be open about it from the beginning. But this hybrid decision, first keeping things hushed and then calling in the press to try to stay the course of justice and score some sympathy votes in the process, worries me. What it tells me is that if Harry Vassallo had got the presidential pardon he asked for, none of us would have known about it. The process was kept quiet right up to that stage, and so the presidential pardon would have been kept quiet too.\\nThis doesn’t ring right. Vassallo has made a political career out of criticising similar failings in other politicians, of telling us that he and his people are the only ones who are squeaky clean, of insisting that AD in a coalition government will police the politicians. Ah, I asked at one point: but then who will police AD?\\nHarry Vassallo has been challenging the prime minister for refusing to enter into coalition with him. After this, the prime minister must be thinking that it’s a damned good thing he warded off those particular advances. Imagine if, at this late stage in the electoral game, the PN and AD were fighting the election as coalition partners, and this news broke. Vassallo can play the small martyred victim now, but as the coalition partner of a large party machine, he wouldn’t have been able to do that all. He would have embarrassed the Nationalist Party hugely, and might even have cost them the election.\\nYes, of course I feel for Harry Vassallo in that position – very much, too. But most of all, I feel for the wife and children whom he has dragged into this appalling mess, standing under the television cameras and blaming the government for persecuting him, as though it was the government who was responsible for filling in his VAT returns.\\nHis persecution mania is now wholly out of control. Some weeks ago, he accused Tonio Fenech of using his (Harry’s) son to score a political point, for which Fenech later apologised. Now here Vassallo is, using his young children to gain sympathy votes at a press conference, portraying himself as the victim of King John’s tax collector. If he doesn’t want his children used, then he should start by not using them himself.\\nChildren of that age should be protected at all times from their parents’ problems. No children so young should be made to stand in front of the cameras and made to worry about things they don’t fully understand, like their father going to prison. I think it is despicable to do this to them. When our front door was set on fire by criminals in the middle of the night 13 years ago, my husband and I worked right through to dawn to clear up the mess, so that when the children woke up, they wouldn’t notice that anything had happened. And then, of course, they went to school and some tactless teacher asked the eldest about it, and he said no, everything was normal at home. I can just imagine how worried those kids are. And it’s not the government’s fault, or the fault of any evil oppressors. It’s their own father who is letting them down.\\nThe latest update as I write this is that the police are investigating because there seems to be a discrepancy between what Vassallo said and what in fact happened.\\nBut this still leaves everyone with a problem – because of course, Harry being Harry, he has made his personal problem a national quandary. If Vassallo goes to prison, we will all be very upset. And if he is given special treatment that is not available to anyone else, purely because he is the leader of a political party, then we shall be upset too – not least because he is the leader of a party that campaigns against just such abuse of the system by politicians.\\nThis isn’t China\\nThere’s a lot of confusion about press cards, so I’m going to weigh in with my two cents’ worth. When I first started working, we didn’t need press cards to go to press conferences. We just turned up. That’s the way it should be. In all these years, I have never had a press card – yet I think you will agree that I am somebody who works for a newspaper.\\nThere were a few times when I needed a press card, but that was only for international conferences and similar events held in Malta. The press card served the purpose of a security pass. It wasn’t proof that I worked for a newspaper. It was proof that I had a reason to enter the premises and that I wasn’t about to let loose with a machine-gun.\\nBecause these events were usually organised by or in association with the government, the security/press pass was issued by the government’s Department of Information. Because the media scene in Malta was still highly undeveloped (a few newspapers and state television and radio), Malta was not accustomed to a system of accreditation by the media organisation itself. This is the system used elsewhere: the press card is issued by the journalist’s employer, and serves simply as proof that the person in question represents that media organisation. It is not proof that he is a journalist.\\nIn the free world, press cards are not issued by the state. I am amazed to find myself having to explain why, when the reasons should be obvious. Any organisation that has the power to issue a press card also has the power to refuse to issue it, and the power to withdraw it. No government should have such power over the very individuals who are there to scrutinise it. Hasn’t this occurred to anyone?\\nStrange ideas about journalism\\nI have noticed over the years that there are some very strange ideas about journalism here in Malta. It is assumed by the Labour Party, for example, that I am paid by the Nationalist Party to write my newspaper column – because a newspaper column written as it should be was completely outside the Maltese experience before I started doing it. Yet it was not outside, for example, the British experience and we are not without London newspapers here. So I can only conclude that the people who think like this don’t read anything except the backs of their cigarette packets.\\nWhen it was pointed out to them that writing a newspaper column is an actual real job, there was much fluttering among the pigeons, and the Labour elves came up with an interesting new insult: ‘You are a paid columnist’. One wishes to weep, but enough of that is being done in public, so forbearance is called for.\\nSeveral years ago, Georg Sapiano, who was then working for television and radio, suggested in conversation that he believed journalists should have warrants like the other professions. (I wouldn’t imagine he still holds the same view as this was a long time ago.) A very heated argument ensued. Journalism is not like accountancy, law, architecture or medicine, I told him. It cannot be put into the same bundle. The other professions require state warrants only for the protection of the citizen, to ensure that clients or patients are not cheated or hurt by a false or fraudulent practitioner.\\nThe role of a journalist is completely different, and a journalist should never be put in a situation where he or she can only write or broadcast with permission from the state (a warrant). This was so obvious that even while I was arguing about it, I felt it was surreal. I argued so forcefully about this that I almost blew Georg’s ears off. Where in the free world do journalists have state warrants?\\nNow, to my great and abiding horror, I discover after a long absence from the press conference scene that the DOI press card is serving a similar purpose. People are not allowed into press conferences given by pompous officials unless they have one – even if they work for the press. It is beyond ridiculous.\\nI have had the most terrible battles about this, but to my great disappointment, I find that instead of insisting that the DOI press card system, which crept up on us unawares, is done away with, the Institute of Journalists and the Committee of Journalists – two rival organisations that share a similar problem of being ridden with the employees of political parties – are helping to shore it up.\\nAnd so the Institute of Journalists, instead of protesting against the fact that a DOI press card is required for entry to Broadcasting Authority political press conferences, has protested that one such card was given to Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando ‘when it shouldn’t have been’. Yes, I agree that Jeffrey shouldn’t have been given a press card, but not for the reasons that the Institute of Journalists is making a fuss about. He didn’t need one because he is a member of parliament, and if a member of parliament – or anyone else for that matter – wishes to attend a press conference being given by the leader of the opposition, he should be free to do so. I can already see the question coming: how can we let everyone in?\\nBut of course we can, and of course we should. We’ve all seen the televised press conferences on international news channels. The rooms are packed, and you can rest assured that nobody is carrying a press card issued by the government. At most – if the person speaking is a global leader – they might have been issued with a security pass after showing proof of accreditation and identity. Are we now saying that when the leader of the opposition or the prime minister gives a press conference, we have to check journalists for bombs and machine-guns?\\nI think that the only reason the more unthinking journalists back up this system is because they imagine it gives them status. It is pointless my trying to explain that journalistic status comes only from the quality of your work, and not from your press card. The fact that I haven’t had a press card for around 15 years does not put me on a lower rung, work wise, than the Super One cameraman who has.\\nThere is a certain amount of insecurity among those who work for the media in Malta. There are many strange beliefs – for example, that you can’t hold a political opinion, or express it, if you are a journalist. The result is reams of newspaper columns and articles in which the writers attack everyone and praise no one so as to seem ‘independent’. In their book, independence, impartiality and sheer indifference are all confused.\\nDOI press cards\\nBut back to the DOI press cards. After the last general election, I went to the then prime minister’s press conference for no greater reason than to catch the mood. We were on track to joining the EU and it was an exciting moment. I wasn’t counting on the woman at the reception desk. ‘Ma tistax tidhol minghajr press card.’\\nShe asked for my name. There wasn’t even the merest flicker of recognition, which led me to conclude that she hadn’t read a single newspaper at any time in the previous 15 years – or listened to Super One. OK, I said – call the soldiers near the door. They’ll recognise me. And of course, they did. Soldiers tend to be good at this kind of thing.\\nStill that wasn’t enough, so I grabbed a copy of the previous Sunday’s edition that was conveniently lying around, flipped to my column and held it up to my face. There, you see? Still no joy – she had been given orders and by God, she was going to follow them to the letter. Then I brought out my identity card and matched the name to the name above the newspaper column. Look, it’s really me. No response – and I couldn’t get any aides because they were all buzzing around upstairs with their phones off.\\nSo I said, right, I’m going up anyway, and I crossed the courtyard, with the receptionist screaming at the soldiers to arrest me and the soldiers quite obviously unwilling to do so because they could see what a farce the whole thing was. Halfway up the stairs I met a junior aide, covered in embarrassment. The dumb receptionist had rung him in a panic to say that a woman without a press card called Daphne Caruana Galizia was making her way upstairs and the soldiers were refusing to cooperate in stopping her.\\nThe junior aide wanted to know why I didn’t have a press card. I explained that I refuse to hold a press card issued by the state, on principle, and it would be pretty pointless anyway, given that a press card is there to prove that you work for the press and roughly the entire country already knows that.\\nI am dismayed to see that the system hasn’t changed, that it has in fact become worse, and that journalists themselves are doing their best to encourage and maintain it, thinking that it is to their benefit when it is actually to their serious detriment.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJoseph Abela posted this comment further along. I’m highlighting it because it’s so tragicomic. Lions of Change, Pigs of Change, DNA Mangion, Jason Robin, and now, the Smarmy Creep of Change – Latin lover Silvio Parnis, hair gelled within an inch of its life, handing out synthetic roses at the school gates in Tarxien. It just gets better and better (or worse and worse).\\nThis morning I took my nephew and niece to Tarxien Primary School and found quite a circus there. Silvio Parnis, his hair sculptured solid – qieshu mrewwha lest ghal zifna bil-kostum fi Pjazza Repubblika – fresh as a daisy and looking delirious with excitement, was handing out imitation red roses to all the mummies and grannies taking their kids to school. I am quite sure he was living an internal George Clooney moment. Such a delirium of grandiosity as cheesy Silvio struck the pose: ‘U din ghalik sinjura…Int taf li jien qatt ma tlabtek xejn, izda haqqni nitolbok il-vot ghal nhar is-Sibt. Ahseb fija.’\\nAll the women were dazed and confused at such a demonstration of gallantry. Many were caught without their best finery as track-suits and leggings were quite the fashion that morning. Many thought it was St. Valentine’s all over again. Others thought it’s Jum il-Mara already. Others just appeared numb at the sheer stupidity of the act. Many commented on the cheapness of the made-in-China rose. Some children cried ‘ghax riedu fjura ghat-teacher’. But the real nugget came when I went to buy my newspapers, and at the stationer’s there were two women with roses in their hands.\\nWoman 1:”U le ta, imma dan genn. Inzied fl-imbarazz jonqosni. Kelli skoss flower arrangements u kollox tajjart ‘l hemm! Ara, issa kif ser nghidlu lil Tony tieghi li Silvio gieni bir-rose fejn l-skola.”\\nWoman 2: “Aw u kemm ihossu! Jien hasadni gie bil-fjura. Madonna, ghidt jigu bil-video go wicci dalghodu – hrigt qisni il-mignuna mid-dar. Mur fehmu li m’ghandhiex grazzja mieghu daqs kemm narah falz. U kif kien baqa bl-storja tad-dar tax-xiha li seraq?”\\nWoman 1: “U fejn naf! Xbajt nisma paroli miz-zewgt nahat. Aw, ha nghidlek – hu u Jason min jippoza l-aktar. L-ghoqda ta’ l-ingravata qisha daqs dinja t-tnejn li huma. Balla n**k.”\\nWoman 2:”Isma, helu hux dak li beka hemm tan-Nigret (Mistra?). U iva, dak ta’ ghajnejh ta’ qattus, hemm – ta’ Gonzi….”.\\nWoman 1: “Jeffrey Pullicino Orland? Hiiiiii, u zgur li gustuz!”\\nEat your heart out, Silvio and Jason (not that Jason would bother much about this one). All the ladies want to cuddle Jeffrey and make him stop crying. Funny how long it’s taken some ‘men’ to find out that a single red rose inevitably has the opposite effect of that intended. Single red roses are associated in women’s minds with publicity stunts, cheap tricks, cheating husbands and importuning gypsies. Enough said.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThat’s the underlying argument to everything he is saying: that because he is the leader of a political party, he shouldn’t be treated like the rest of us. We have to fill in our VAT returns, we have to pay our fines if we don’t, but he doesn’t – because he’s Harry Vassallo, leader of AD. And since when is not having the money to pay your fine a valid excuse for not paying it? Try using that excuse the next time you get fined and see how far it will get you. Oh, but you’re not the leader of a political party that’s playing the victim, so you can’t call a press conference and make a fuss about it. You just have to ask your family to lend you the money and then hope you can pay them back.\\nI’m going to use the vernacular again here: sorry, ta – but isn’t this the political party that wants us to believe that it is a cut above the rest and ‘not like the MLPN’? Now here we have its leader, breaking the law and expecting special treatment because he is who he is. And when he doesn’t get that special treatment he calls a press conference, iziffen it-tfal fin-nofs, and tries to score brownie points (and avoid paying his dues) by playing the martyred victim. Why on earth isn’t his wife protecting her children from their father’s political opportunism? How indecent it is to expose those poor little children to the glare of public scrutiny and all that worry they must be feeling, just so that their father can play Poor Harry. It’s unforgivable. I would never have allowed my husband to do something like that – not that, thank God, he would ever have been so hellishly irresponsible, first mucking up his financial affairs and then using the children to pull in the sympathy vote.\\nWhy should Harry Vassallo get away with not paying his fines when there are hundreds of ordinary people out there who have had to pay theirs? This is just too much. Lots of people default on their payments or get fined for not filling in returns. The reason they don’t go to jail is because they pay their dues, even if they have to reach an agreement with the VAT Department to pay their dues by instalments. There have been amnesties since then which Vassallo could have used – but he obviously thinks he is too much of a cut above the rest to have to deal with the problems that we ordinary mortals have to put up with all the time, like filling in forms and dealing with bureaucrats. Why should he have to bother with all that? After all, he’s Poor Harry.\\nIf we have to pay our fines, then so does Harry Vassallo\\nVassallo clearly expects to be treated differently because he is the leader of a political party. What he is saying, in effect, is that he doesn’t want to pay the fines but he doesn’t want to go to jail either. Try doing that if you are not the leader of a political party, and see how far it will get you.\\nSome people, or so I have heard, have succeeded in having their sentences waived through a presidential pardon. Vassallo thought he would try to take advantage of this system. It didn’t work. He shouldn’t have tried in the first place. As the leader of a political party – particularly a political party that prides itself on being purer than the driven snow and different to all the rest – he should realise that he is in a different position to the man-in-the-street. He is in a position of responsibility. He has to be even more careful than the rest.\\nSo he broke the law (however unwittingly and however much we may sympathise with him for not putting his papers in order – we all know it’s a bloody bore) got fined, didn’t pay the fine, got a prison sentence, put in a plea for a presidential pardon, it didn’t work, and now he is kicking up a fuss and accusing the government of persecuting him. If he had got that presidential pardon, I imagine he wouldn’t have advertised the fact. And that’s where we realise that there’s nothing special or virginal about Harry Vassallo. He’s just another politician who’s looking after No. 1 and trying to get away with it.\\nAnd what about that presidential pardon?\\nNow here’s the thing that’s being overlooked. Pleas for presidential pardons go before the cabinet, or at least before the Minister of Justice, who must put in a recommendation to the president. This means that the cabinet knew about the AD leader’s problems with the law – but decently, they kept it quiet and didn’t leak the story to the press. They did so not because they had a hidden agenda but because decent men do not go about leaking stories about other politicians’ financial troubles. Vassallo himself is the one who leaked the story – and what’s more, he did so deliberately on the eve of an election when he thought it would serve the double purpose of helping him squirrel out of paying his dues while at the same time pulling in some ‘poor Harry’ votes.\\nHarry Vassallo has known about this for months. He lost one of those cases all the way back in 2005. Yes, he has had special treatment – very special treatment – because the authorities have bent over backwards to give him as much time as possible to pay what he owes. The police didn’t go to his home to arrest him. They went to his home to try to persuade him bil-kelma it-tajba that as the leader of AD and a public person, he should regularise his position. And Harry Vassallo seized on that and turned himself and his financial troubles into a public circus involving his poor, poor children. What a shame.\\nJust pay what you owe, Harry!\\nOK, so you can say that the bastard government could have recommended the AD leader’s plea for a pardon to the president, and didn’t do so for spiteful reasons. If you think this way, you’re not very imaginative and have poor knowledge of political strategy. If the government wanted to damn the AD leader once and for all, all it had to do was recommend him for a presidential pardon and then make it known that the AD leader’s fines for VAT irregularities had been pardoned by the president.\\nThe immediate effect among the electorate would be ‘Iss hej, the leader of a political party gets special treatment and I have to pay my fines.’ It wouldn’t exactly have helped Vassallo climb in the popularity stakes, and would have exposed him for what he is – just another politician looking after No. 1 and hoping that others don’t find out. If the government wanted to be really mean, it would have approved Vassallo’s presidential pardon, said nothing, and created a situation where it had ‘one over on him’ – a blackmail situation, if you will. It’s precisely because the government is made up of decent people (love them or hate them) that this wasn’t done. But I wouldn’t put it past a Labour government to do something like that – they seem to adore that kind of ghastly behaviour.\\nVassallo doesn’t have to go to prison, but he does have to pay his fines. If we have to pay ours, then he has to pay his. He’s got to cast around for the money, find it and pay it. That’s what you would have to do, and it’s what I would have to do. Vassallo has no right to expect special treatment or to cry foul if he doesn’t get treated better than the rest. Nobody wants him to go to prison, and the prison authorities have enough to cope with without finding room to house Harry Vassallo or the budget to keep him there for two years.\\nEnough of this drama already. Pay what you owe, Harry – it’s what the public expects of you.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn the course of this electoral campaign, Labour has put up a performance of tragicomedy that may reassure its hardcore supporters and leave others mildly bemused, but which makes the rest of us desperate in our anger that such behaviour is still possible.\\nAside from Alfred Sant’s brief propulsion to power on the back of an opportunistic promise to remove VAT in 1996, the Labour Party last won a clear electoral majority in 1976 – a full 32 years ago. Even in the election before that, in 1971, Dom Mintoff only reached the premiership on the strength of literally a handful of votes. Whoever those people were, they set in train a 16-year period of destruction, corruption and violence that eventually brought Malta to its knees, wrecked the economy and caused widespread civil unrest, pushing the country backwards while free Europe surged forwards, and handicapping us for years to come.\\nThirty-seven years later, the economic damage is undone, thanks to the exceptional efforts and ability of this government. While they are deserving of our criticism on several fronts – too churchy, not enough consideration given to the environment, a tendency to be indifferent to some people’s need for personal attention – they absolutely cannot be faulted on this one. And at the end of the day, it is what counts for most, because without a solid economy and high employment levels, there’s no time or money to be expended on the ancillaries.\\nFor those of my generation, who were forced to live shrunken lives deprived of all opportunity, there can be no going back and nothing can make up for what we lost. It would be nice to have some kind of apology from the Labour Party for what they did to us, but we’ll never hear anything of the sort. Alfred Sant has no regrets. To him, the difficult lives we had no choice but to lead are just so much water under the bridge.\\nUnforgivable\\nWhat is truly unforgivable is how he and the Labour Party, not satisfied with that mad, bad litany of serious misprints and malfunctions over 16 years, then tried to do the same to this generation of young people and all future generations to come. They fought hard to keep Malta out of Europe, and in so doing, to deny young people the EU citizenship that has set them free. Alfred Sant, like his Labour predecessors, knows only how to wreck and pillage. If Labour has the slightest bit of empathy for those whose lives it ruins or damages, then it doesn’t show it.\\nThe Labour Party is not fit to govern. It has never been fit to govern. Yet it hasn’t asked itself why, except for the fluke electoral victory that ended in the government’s collapse just 22 months later, it hasn’t won a single election since 1976, and won the one before that by just a few votes. The party permits no auto-criticism, instead silencing dissent and eliminating internal opponents with the determination of Josef Stalin. It has much the same approach to external criticism, going after those who mock or criticise with the equivalent of an army of tanks, searching and destroying. Not even booing, hissing students are safe.\\nLabour’s internal monitoring and quality control systems are so weak, or non-existent, that the party has been hijacked by a serial loser who is an electoral liability and a dangerous prospect for Malta.\\nHis was the first Maltese government to collapse since Independence. He couldn’t keep it together for longer than 22 months. He went on to lose two general elections and the single most important referendum in Maltese history. To top it all, he first claimed that he had won, and then insulted the entire population of Malta – those who voted No as well as those who voted Yes – by saying that he would ignore what they had to say. He’s still repeating the same thing today. He was booed so loudly at the university precisely because this is what he told the students: that he doesn’t acknowledge referendums, that he doesn’t care what they think.\\nLabour – no quality control\\nIf the Labour Party had those quality control mechanisms in place, Alfred Sant would have been put out to grass in 1998. The party allowed him to hang on and hijack the show in the same way that he became leader in 1992, in a process shrouded in mystery and laden with accusations. Instead, he remains here today after 10 solid years of losses, still saying he has no regrets, still insisting that we all look to the future like lemmings heading for the cliff-edge while ignoring his shocking past.\\nThose who support the Labour Party insist that it’s “their turn now”. They speak, incredibly, as though power is something that is owed to a political party on a rota basis, without the party having to do anything to deserve it, or to show that it is fit to govern. If that were the case, then we might as well do away with elections altogether, and just allow the two main parties to take five- or 10-year turns at the wheel.\\nThe Labour Party really has no understanding of what it means to govern. Like the less enlightened of its supporters, achieving the seat of government is an end in itself, rather than the means to the end of making Malta a better place to live. This is clear from everything the shadow cabinet says and does. We never hear them speak of their plans. We only hear them say Ha nkunu fil-gvern and La nkunu fil-gvern. What are they going to do then? They have no idea, and that’s why they have spent five weeks of the electoral campaign throwing mud and chucking insults about instead of telling us.\\nThe Nationalist Party has changed beyond recognition over the decades. It is not the same party it was in 1971; it is not even recognisable. But Labour remains unchanged. Sometimes you hear people saying, “Oh, but all the thugs have been removed.” I want to laugh and cry when I hear this. Labour expects praise because it removed its thugs? It shouldn’t have had those thugs in the first place. I’ll praise Labour if it enters the modern age, and becomes a party that is fit to run the country, and not because 16 years ago it removed a bunch of thugs for the cynical purpose of image-making.\\nThe Labour Party has singularly failed to adapt to changing times and changing circumstances. Its 60-year-old leader is still stuck in the early 1970s, repeating the discourse that would have been familiar to young people in 1968, but which is disengaged from contemporary reality. Everything the party does is inept, disorganised, inefficient, burdened by error and inadequacy. This is a political party which hopes to achieve government but which cannot put together even an electoral manifesto without a hundred mistakes which it then describes, futilely, as misprints and computer malfunctions.\\nIf Labour wins this election, it will be by default. It is not a party which inspires confidence in its ability to govern. Any new votes it claims it is attracting are negative votes – the votes of the people who want to punish this government for not giving them X, Y or Z, the votes of people who don’t particularly want anything for themselves, but who want to deprive others of what they perceive to be an unfair access to favourable networks. Schadenfreude is a strong driving force, but sadly, it takes just months for the pleasurable effect to wear off, and for regret and dissatisfaction to set in. And that’s why the Maltese rushed in their thousands to vote Sant out of power just 22 months after they had voted him in on a wave of glory and red flags.\\nLabour needs to clean out its house\\nThe Labour Party needs to clean out its house. If Alfred Sant wins this election, and because of the apathy, indifference and self-destructive spite of some he has a very good chance of doing so, it will be the worst thing that can possibly happen to Labour. The party will not be able to get rid of him then. It will not be able to set in train much-needed reform. It will not be able to begin the process by which it moves closer in structure, shape and modernity to the Nationalist Party. It will be finished. Winning this election will not be the renaissance of Labour, but its ultimate downfall. And many within the Labour Party know this, and resent being hoist by Alfred Sant’s petard.\\nGive us peace in our time\\nAs for what will become of Malta, it doesn’t even bear contemplation. Sant’s last stint in power was so bad that the newspaper headlines speak for themselves. Practically every organisation in this country was up in arms. There was worry, concern, brow-beating, panic, wonderment at the craziness of it all. The economy ground to a halt. Unemployment soared. What was it all for? Some people wanted to pay back a few other people. Some people wanted to remove VAT. It wasn’t worth it.\\nAnd even now, it just isn’t worth it either. A quiet life is beyond price.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe Police Commissioner has explained the train of events, and it looks like another case of MLPAD – now even the AD leader is twisting the truth. Read this report from www.timesofmalta.com today.\\n\\nPolice Commissioner explains how Vassallo was informed about the arrest warrants\\nThe Police Commissioner in a statement this afternoon said a sergeant at Sliema police station informed AD leader Harry Vassallo about the arrest warrants issued against him when he went to his office to make inquiries about a burglary. The Commissioner explained that on October 15, 2007 the police received two arrest warrants issued by the Courts on September 27, 2007 against Dr Vassallo over unpaid fines which had been converted into a prison term. On October 18, 2007 the two warrants were sent to the Sliema police for execution. They were handed to the sergeant at Sliema police station on November 12 but were not executed. Since this sergeant was no longer posted at Sliema, on February 7 the warrants were handed to another sergeant. On March 1 this sergeant was involved in investigations into a burglary in Sliema. Since Dr Vassallo’s family had vacant property close to where the burglary took place, the sergeant, as was the norm, felt he needed to speak to Dr Vassallo to establish whether there was access from the Vassallo property to the property where the burglary took place.\\nAfter having phoned Dr Vassallo, the sergeant on Wednesday called on Dr Vassallo at his office. Once he was going there, the sergeant felt he should also speak to Dr Vassallo about the arrest warrants. According to the sergeant and the constable who accompanied him, they spoke to Dr Vassallo about their investigations into the burglary as well as the warrants. They asked Dr Vassallo to regularise his position instead of them having to proceed with the arrest as authorised by the court. The meeting had been a very cordial one and matters stopped there, the police said. Both the sergeant and the police constable categorically denied having communicated with a Media.link journalist or anybody else about the case. They also volunteered to make a sworn statement about the case. The Commissioner said he was asking the chairman of the Police Board, Judge Franco Depasquale, to hold an inquiry into the case.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOur feathered friend Alfred Sant morphed back into a cross between Lord Voldemort and Darth Vader yesterday evening and was busy beneath one of his wigwams, inciting yet another of his mobs into a mad frenzy against those who dare insist that the leader of AD pays his fine or serves his sentence.\\nAs the red-sweatered crowd screeched its appreciation, I sat and wondered at the mysterious ways in which people swallow this man’s application of two weights and two measures. On the one hand, he commissions books about l-iskandlu tal-Mistra and persecutes Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. On the other hand, he defends the leader of a political party who breaks the law, doesn’t pay his fines, and then turns the matter into a media circus to avoid having to settle his dues.\\nIt’s the MLPAD all over again. If you’re going to be voting for any coalition, like Claire Bonello and Arnold Cassola keep telling you to do, this is the one you’ll get. As for me, I’ve had enough of self-serving truth-twisters.\\nRead this latest update from www.timesofmalta.com\\n\\nVassallo convicted twice – Court Registrar\\nThe Registrar of the Criminal Court, Paul Miruzzi, in a statement this afternoon explained how ‘conviction tickets’ were issued by the courts against AD leader Harry Vassallo after two convictions by the courts.\\nHe explained that on November 17, 2005 Dr Vassallo, as a person registered with the VAT Department, was arraigned before the Magistrates’ Court and accused of having failed to conform to a sentence against him handed down by the Magistrates’ Court on November 5, 2002. He was accused of having failed to obey a court order to comply with the law within two months, failing which he would be fined Lm6 for every day that the original fine remained unpaid. Dr Vassallo told the court that he was a lawyer and did not require legal counsel. After hearing the prosecution and Dr Vassallo and considering the evidence, the court condemned Dr Vassallo to pay Lm3,954. On August 3, 2007 the Registrar of the Criminal Courts was informed of a petition to the President, dated January 3, 2006, with regard to the court sentence. On September 18, 2007 the Registrar was informed that the petition had been turned down. On September 27, 2007 the Registrar issued a conviction ticket against Dr Vassallo and passed it on to the police for execution. On September 28, 2008 the courts had handed down another sentence against Dr Vassallo. Dr Vassallo had faced the same charges but over a different period of time. After considering the evidence, the court convicted Dr Vassallo and fined him Lm2,100. After having verified that there was no other plea for a presidential pardon, the registrar on September 27, 2007 issued another conviction ticket against Dr Vassallo and passed it on to the police for execution.\\nAnd Harry Vassallo loves a good lie-in\\nPink magazine interviewed the wives of the political party leaders, or least the three who have one. I decided that Mrs Vassallo should be given a medal for heroism, while her husband needs to be reminded that this is no longer the Victorian age. All the women in my family were struck by the same thing: Mrs Vassallo’s description of how she wakes up at 6am every day, rushes round cleaning, tidying, sorting things out and getting the children ready for school. Then at 8.30am she tiptoes into the bedroom with a cup of tea for Harry and wakes him to start his day, before she rushes off to earn the family bread. She rushes back from her job, cooks and shops, does some more tidying and sorting, and has everything spick and span and food on the table for the master of the house whenever he chooses to return from whatever he has been doing all day (knocking on the neighbours’ doors and telling them to vote for a coalition, probably).\\nAaaaarrrrghhhhhh! There, I’ve got that off my chest.\\nA few days later, I was reading some of Vassallo’s rubbish about family life, and how if AD is elected to the coalition government of his dreams, he will ensure that women have extended maternity leave. And I thought: what do you know about that, buster?\\nWhere I come from, it’s the men who wake up at the crack of dawn, bring their wives a cup of tea in bed, and then rush off to earn the family bread – especially if the wife is going to be busy earning some of it too. And they’re expected to pull their weight with the chores, or failing that, to pay somebody else to do so. In our neck of the woods, lazy men are not allowed.\\nIn the media circus surrounding his ‘fine or imprisonment’ problem, Vassallo squeaked in protest that if his sole source of income is Lm400 a month as leader of AD, he shouldn’t be expected to be able to pay Lm6,000. Try telling him that’s his problem, when he is so busy right now telling us that it’s ours. Hasn’t anyone ever told him that his first duty is towards his wife and children, not towards himself and politics? I can understand that he is too busy to work and earn money in an electoral campaign, but there isn’t much to keep the leader of a political party (without a single seat in parliament) occupied for the other four years and nine months. So how does he spend his time, while his wife cooks, cleans, earns money, shops for food and looks after the children? Sleeping (another thing he has in common with Alfred Sant)? Reading (ditto)? Writing propaganda articles (ditto)? Trying to convince his neighbours of the wisdom of a coalition government? At least Alfred Sant has some chickens to feed in a coop at the end of his garden (feathered friends for our feathered friend).\\nHarry Vassallo’s lifestyle is beyond my comprehension, but that’s because I am unnaturally prejudiced against men who allow their wives to work much, much harder than they do, running around in circles trying to keep a hundred balls up in the air while their husbands float around and dream. Perhaps in this I am sexist, because I am not similarly prejudiced against women who float around and dream while their husband works his socks off (though I do think they are a bit of a waste of space). But there’s something that bothers me a lot about a man who lets a woman lift far more than her fair share of the burden. It doesn’t ring right.\\nVassallo’s excuse that he can’t work because he’s too busy with AD strikes me as the false protest of the shirker. There are lots of politicians who are far, far busier than he is in their political work, but who still succeed in holding down their day job. This may not be ideal, and in several cases it leads to conflict of interest, but that’s only because they have a parliamentary seat – and Vassallo does not. There is no conflict of interest involved for him. Besides, I use this only as an example that, if you are a hard-working man and not a lazy one, you’ll work all the hours God sends to provide for your children and even for your wife if she is looking after them, and still have time for your political hobbies or even your political work. After all, Vassallo is in a more privileged position than most, because he has a profession which allows him to be self-employed and to make his own hours. He doesn’t have to answer to a boss or be a salaried man at the office between 9am and 5pm.\\nInstead of sleeping until his wife wakes him at 8.30am with a cup of tea every day, Harry Vassallo should have been filling in some forms.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n“Jaghzluna mhux skond kemm ahna kapaci nhammgu, imma kemm ahna kapaci nwettqu ghal kulhadd” – Lawrence Gonzi tells Alfred Sant where to put his obsession with korruzzjoni. The final debate between the two leaders is aired tonight at 2030hrs on TVM.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOr at least, that’s what Lawrence Gonzi told him in the final debate on TVM earlier tonight. Meanwhile, Squawking Sant went diligently through his list of phrases-which-I-must-use-every-time-I-speak-in-public. Good governance. Korruzzjoni lampanti. Bidla trankwilla. Stil modern ta’ tmexxija. Kafe jew tnejn. Stagnar.\\nThen he brought out his list of reasons why we should vote Labour for a bidla trankwilla. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and his tenant at Mistra. A health report on the government website that lists ‘miscellaneous fees’ (the fees paid by those who are not Maltese or British). A four-year-old report about health payments rejected by Gonzi with the words ‘Over my dead body.’ Oh yes, and his latest one: Malta is now the Ukraine of the Mediterranean because Harry Vassallo refused to pay his VAT fines and fill in his VAT forms and he now risks imprisonment.\\n‘You’ve got a nerve, you weirdo,’ I yelled at the television. ‘And were the hell where you in 1985? Oh yes, you were president of the corrupt, hellish and violent Labour Party. Ghax ma’ tmurx tinheba!’\\nTalk about reinventing himself – this man has some brass neck to even mention the word ‘corruption’. I wish Gonzi had had the presence of mind to remind Sant exactly where he was when the Labour Party had turned Malta into the Zimbabwe of the Mediterranean. I would have loved to hear him reply (robotic voice): ‘I don’t talk about history. That’s water under the bridge.’\\nSo what did he say that was exciting enough to tempt me to vote Labour? Don’t hold your breath: nothing but more neurotic obsessing about korruzzjoni lampanti – a field in Mistra and a pavement outside Ninu Zammit’s house. Yes, I really can’t wait until Saturday to rush to the polling-station to give them my Number One.\\nA mistake that will go down in history\\nWhat I remember most from the final debate between Squawking Sant and Eddie Fenech Adami in 2003 was the sound of Sant heckling Fenech Adami as the credits rolled. This time, he did all his heckling at the start of the show. Gonzi was trying to explain something, and all I could hear was The Feathered One clucking and squawking and interrupting while the moderator made no attempt at stopping him.\\nGonzi was on top form, speaking for many of us when he told Sant about his visit to the Police Commissioner: ‘Allura filghaxija tghidlu ‘paraventu’, imbaghad filghodu tmur ghandu u tiehu l-gazzetti mieghek halli taghmel show. L-aqwa l-show, mhux ir-rapport.’\\nI wish the camera had panned to Sant’s face when Gonzi told him that his mistake of refusing to join the European Union would go down in history: ‘a historic mistake.’ This really must have bitten deep, because Sant believes that he was born to lead Malta, destined to become the greatest prime minister in the history of the country – and at 60, an age when most are looking back at their achievements, he is still hoping to achieve this dream, with the rest of us paying the price.\\nHall of mirrors\\nWell, you have to hand it to our feathered friend. He really knows how to distort reality. One of my sons (the one who rightly told the Super One harasser where to go and how to do it) emerged from his bedroom bug-eyed in wonder at the sound of The Feathered One’s bleating about how Malta is stagnating, how ‘taht GonziPN il-pajjiz mar lura.’\\n‘Is he mad?’ he asked. ‘I’m the wrong person to ask because I’m not a psychiatrist,’ I said. ‘Let’s just conclude that he’s partly deaf and blind and has a distorted view of reality.’ The ‘son of Daphne’ went back to his bedroom, another first-time voter who’s turned his back on the clucking chicken.\\nSant also has a whole list of petty obsessions, like not calling the new hospital by its name. ‘L-isptar tal-Qroqq,’ he keeps saying, and this time Gonzi corrected him off camera: ‘Mater Dei jismu.’ Then he launched into a description of why he thinks Malta is a worse place now than it was when he was running the country (into the ground). Off camera, I could hear Gonzi sigh with exasperation: ‘U Giezu, minn fejn igibhom; x’affarijiet dawn.’\\nYes, really – x’affarijiet dawn. We have got to this stage – an electoral contest between the man who has worked wonders in four years and a cowardly weirdo in a wig who calls his mummy when students boo him, whose government collapsed in chaos after 22 months, and who has lost two general elections and one referendum. And we don’t know which one will win. That’s the real obscenity.\\nGodard Pastizzerija – Prop. A. Sant\\nFor the best qassatat in town, check out this link.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe mass meetings are on Super One and Net as I write this – two tribes, except that one tribe is grimly massing for war and the other tribe is having a giant party. And no, it’s not just the poor quality of the filming on Super One and all those red pennants that make me think the crowd looks tensed up for battle.\\nI’d actually forgotten – unbelievably – that there are mass meetings on the final day of the campaign, and so last Sunday I watched the rather deflated exercise on the Granaries and thought, oh well. Meanwhile, on Super One, Alfred Sant’s rag-tag army was gearing up for war, with Sant himself making Hitlerian-type speeches from the stage, with all the modernity of a 1930s demagogue. It wasn’t a happy sight, either – not at all.\\nToday was different on the Granaries, though not at the old military parade ground. I set great store by the final meetings, because they are the culmination of the entire five weeks of campaigning, and sum up the spirit of the campaign. So this evening I have different thoughts. The atmosphere on the Granaries is joyful – not the joy of power or the joy of victory or even the joy of spiting others. No, it’s the joy of positive thinking. This time, it’s the crowd at the former parade ground that seems uncertain.\\nLabour mass meetings of the past few years have invariably been negative, but this one is doubly so. I’m not surprised the crowd feel and look that way, forced as they are to listen to angry speaker after angry speaker, all of them with grim expressions, never a smile, never a word of hope or faith, but only the promise that soon il-gvern ikun taghna u naghmlu festa.\\nAlfred Sant tries to smile\\nAlfred Sant did try to smile. He must have registered my description of the lot of them as cross vultures and a deathly funeral procession, and so on the stage his stiff face did a little bit of cracking but it just didn’t look convincing. He and his sidekick Jason have the appearance of a couple of shady cheats who are trying to sell me something I don’t want or need, that has no guarantee and will break down after a couple of days. All they need is a checked suit and bow-tie and the picture is complete.\\nBzonn ta’ bidla\\nLabour being the slick and professional outfit that it is, the stage backdrop at the mass meeting was perfectly chosen: BZONN TA’ BIDLA written in HUGE letters just behind the main speaker, a certain Alfred Sant. I’m sure that a thousand people were telling their televisions that they couldn’t agree more.\\nFor the final week of Labour’s ‘campaign’, the slogan Bidu Gdid has become Bzonn ta’ Bidla. Yes, that’s right. Get him out of the way immediately, and then perhaps things will start happening.\\nOver on Net, Lawrence Gonzi was in fighting form. What a relief – he’s been looking a little beaten down over the past few days. Faced by thousands upon thousands of young people he was in his element. On the whole, young people don’t relate to Alfred Sant – he’s like a stiff old grandfather who’s lost touch with the new generation. And quite frankly, if I were 18 I would be dead embarrassed to be associated with a creepy guy in a wig who never smiles, never laughs, can’t get his act together, stomps around in a funereal procession with a pretty-boy and a couple of extras from a New York Italian gangster film, and did his utmost to keep me out of the European Union. It’s funny how Squawking Sant has no regrets about any of this.\\nListening to Gonzi was cathartic for me. ‘Hekk, hekk, say it, tell him!’ I yelled from the comfort of my sofa, being too wiped out to hike over to Floriana. Then I flicked over to Super One and booed and hissed to my heart’s delight, making rude noises with my lips for good measure and throwing in a couple of reverse salutes for fun. I would have thrown rotten tomatoes, too, but then I would have been the one to clean up the mess, so I didn’t. And you should have heard how many times I said ***k off too. And ***hole. And w**ker. And worse. If that ‘tobby’ with the camera from Super One were there, he would have had a field-day, and so would Miss Miriam Dalli, head of Super One News, who is currently providing entertainment for the nation (you sow the wind, Miss Dalli, and you reap the whirlwind).\\nAntennae in lipstick\\nOne of my sisters painted antennae in lipstick around Squawking Sant’s head on the television screen, a process made simpler by the fact that once he takes up a position, he doesn’t move – ‘to make watching him more amusing,’ she said, ‘otherwise I just have to fight the urge to slap the television.’ I told her she should have just switched him off. But here’s the thing, you see: watching him is creepily addictive.\\nWhat does Squawking Sant have to offer us? Nothing. Ask him why we should vote Labour and he has no answer. That’s why the T-shirt with the slogan ‘Nivvota Labour? Inz**bab!’ has been such a knock-out best-seller. It sums up the popular sentiment perfectly. I have to hand it to the Maltese language: it’s very expressive at times.\\nKorruzzjoni Lampanti Sant\\nBack over on Net, Gonzi was asking why on earth we should choose to leave the country in the hands of somebody who doesn’t even have the guts to face an audience of students, and who runs out to send in his tanks (my choice of words) when they boo him for being a prat.\\nGonzi’s messages of hope contrasted heavily with Korruzzjoni Lampanti Sant’s messages of gloom and doom. Unbelievably, he was using his very last hours of campaigning to continue ranting and raving about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando – something DNA Mangion had already done before him (with the requisite death-mask expression) and the mention of ‘miscellaneous fees’ in a health services report that is readily available on the government website.\\nVote Labour because a Nationalist MP’s tenant applied to the MEPA to develop a field? Is that the best you can do? Inz**bab. I’m sorry to be crass, but no polite words fit this particular bill. How did we end up with an Opposition party that’s little more than a giant freak show? This man’s idea of campaigning is to shout negative messages, rant on about a field in Mistra, and wave old-hat documents around, while obsessing about korruzzjoni lampanti. You should know all there is to know about corruption, Mr President Of The MLP in 1984.\\nThe latest update on Please-Jail-Me Harry\\nThis report came from www.timesofmalta.com before it was taken off line due to the blanket ban on political reporting.\\n“The Finance Ministry said this afternoon that contrary to what was claimed yesterday by Alternattiva Demokratika leader Harry Vassallo, according to the Registry of Companies the company Abelweld Ltd still existed and Dr Vassallo was shown as being its majority shareholder, director, company secretary and the person legally responsible for the company.”\\n“It was not the case, therefore, that Dr Vassallo no longer represented the company, as he claimed yesterday. Therefore, the ministry said, when Dr Vassallo informed the VAT Department that he was no longer responsible, he was misleading the department.”\\n“The ministry said that a presidential pardon could not be given to Dr Vassallo because he was refusing to fill in the 37 VAT returns covering the period for which the courts found him to be legally responsible and guilty. Dr Vassallo, however, was still in time to regularise his position by filling in the VAT forms for the years at issue so that his plea for a pardon could be considered.”\\n“The ministry also published the report of the VAT Commissioner on the case. In his report the VAT commissioner said Dr Vassallo registered the company for VAT purposes on September 29, 1994. The company did not submit VAT returns between August 1, 1999 and July 31, 2005. It sent one return in 1999 but failed to file the other 37 due to date. After several warnings, legal action was instituted by the police. The police sued Dr Vassallo as the person responsible under the law and he was arraigned on November 2002, convicted and fined Lm100 and Lm6 for every day that he failed to settle the fine.”\\n“Since Dr Vassallo did not follow the court’s orders, fresh legal action was instituted in November 2005. Dr Vassallo was again found guilty and fined a total of Lm3,954 covering the period January 2003 to October 2004. Dr Vassallo was arraigned again in May 2005 on similar charges, convicted once more and again fined Lm100. Since he did not submit the returns, Dr Vassallo was again arraigned in September 2006 and fined Lm2,100.”\\n“In January 2006 Dr Vassallo requested a presidential pardon but since the returns were still not submitted, the request was denied. The commissioner said Dr Vassallo was still a major shareholder of the company Abelweid Limited as well as director and legal representative.”\\nThey’re promising a 20,000 landslide victory for Labour\\nYes, and they’re also promising to strike oil when they’re in government. The leader of the Opposition, who lays eggs and clucks in his spare time, said when asked under one of his wigwams whether Malta would find oil: ‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’ Then he promised to ask for the resignation of Joe Mizzi, the silly sod who was Minister Without Portfolio in Sant’s last cabinet and who is earmarked as Minister for Oil this time round, if oil is not struck.\\nThe story has been spun for Labour supporters that a 20,000 landslide victory is on the cards. The last time I remember a story so stupid and irresponsible was in 1996, when it was put about that the Nationalists were expecting a landslide victory by 16,000 votes. Well, we all know what happened then.\\nIn raising supporters’ expectations so high, Labour’s leaders are setting themselves up for a big fall should they lose. There is no way they can win by a landslide, but they do have a good chance of winning by default, and in that case, nobody is going to say ‘Look, you promised us 20,000 and we only won by 2,000’. A win is a win is a win, and nobody will be doing any nitpicking.\\nIf Labour loses, it’s different. Promising supporters a win is a big risk. Promising a landslide victory is an even greater gamble. The higher expectations are pushed, the sorer the losers are, and then those who made reckless promises are blamed and whipped for it. It would have been wiser for the Labour leaders to say nothing, or to keep expectations safely lower. Ah, but that’s too much to expect. The Labour leader is a chicken, but those around him have chicken-brains if they haven’t worked this one out.\\nPlaying for high stakes\\nThey’re playing for very, very high stakes indeed – their political lives. Squawking Sant has not a hope in hell of sitting tight through yet another electoral loss. His deputies will go down with him, even though the bawling Lion of Change is already elbowing his way in. If Labour chooses him as leader, then Labour is truly insane. It has long needed a leader who appeals to the middle classes – sane, safe, no class hatred seeping out of every pore, no vicious language or vile behaviour, no posturing instead of policies. The Lion of Change will be just a throw-back to Dom Mintoff, but without the brains. The man can buy himself all the swimming-pools in the world but he’ll never have any style, and his mental horizons remain limited to santi tal-Madonna fil-but, fireworks, the Stella Maris festa, yodelling at mass meetings, screeching inanities, and hunting in Romania.\\nIt struck me over the course of this campaign that though the single biggest issue is the economy, the underlying issue is class hatred and suspicion of The Other. I have never felt so much class hatred over the last few general elections as I have in this campaign. What’s most interesting is that the class hatred is one way only: those who have a chip on their shoulder about their origins hating those who they think are privileged, well-connected, well-born, blessed with this, that or the other.\\nI had thought all this was dead and buried with Mintoff’s days, but apparently it’s not. The Labour leaders have tapped into it, and have played it for all it’s worth throughout the campaign. Incitement of class hatred is what underpins all those remarks about xi haga hazina fid-DNA, George Vella’s hysterical rabble-rousing speech about students who come from privileged backgrounds, Alfred Sant’s constant winding up of people to get them to think that they are the have-nots and that the haves have run off with more than their fair share, and all the rest of it.\\nWhat perplexes me most is that the kind of class hatred that Dom Mintoff engendered still survives today, even though everyone is so much better off and education and good career opportunities are accessible to all who want them. Mintoff created a monster that just won’t go away. Parked outside the Labour meeting at Luxol last Sunday there were hundreds of really expensive cars, including giant SUVs which cost almost as much as a small flat. And yet the people who drove them to the old military parade ground to listen to an incompetent and hate-driven has-been rabble-rouse and incite hatred still feel they’re not the real McCoy. They still feel they’re outside the game, that they’re not quite good enough, that the way to get to the top is by shoving aside those who they think were born privileged and trampling on their heads to show them who’s the boss.\\nNo matter how much money they earn, and even if they earn 10 times as much as the tal-pepe person down the road, they will always feel they are not quite good enough, and Korruzzjoni Lampanti Sant and that absolutely horrible George Vella encourage them in this.\\nLawrence Gonzi wonders out loud why Labour is always preaching negativity, jealousy and discouragement, why it tells its supporters that they are not good enough. Here’s the answer why: because as soon as people shed their innate inferiority complex or their bitter hang-ups they no longer want to be associated with a bunch of inadequate losers. There are some exceptions, yes – smart, chip-free people who support Labour – but truly, they are the exceptions who prove the rule, the swallows that don’t make the summer.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nDo you really expect us to vote for you tomorrow, on the 5th anniversary of the day you told us that you don’t care what we think? And after you told us that you have no regrets for claiming that partnership won, no regrets for telling us that you still don’t acknowledge the referendum result, and no\\nregrets for brushing our wishes aside? You must be joking.\\n\\nThese photographs were taken by Florence-based photographer Daniel Cilia at the Nationalist Party mass meeting yesterday evening.\\nChoose the man best fit to be prime minister\\nHere’s last night’s debate between Gonzi and Sant.\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT: Debate 2008 (Part 1)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT: Debate 2008 (Part 2)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 3)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 4)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 5)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 6)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 7)\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:05 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:06 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:06 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:06 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:07 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:07 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:07 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nSomebody called David Camilleri, who has an AD-Ghawdex Internet address, but who is emailing everyone to tell them to vote Labour to bring down the Nazi government, has a fresh bee buzzing in his bonnet. This is animal rights. Apparently, we should vote Labour because Alfred Sant loves animals and Lawrence Gonzi doesn’t.\\nI don’t know where he got this one. What’s the proof that Squawking Sant loves animals – the fact that he keeps a clutch of chickens in his backyard? Maybe he keeps them because there’s a fellow-feeling between them. I’d like to see him handle the curious advances of a sniffing dog: ‘Tmissnix, jekk joghgbok.’ Mr I’m-so-frozen-I-chilled-the-EU-application-by-slipping-it-into-my-underpants will probably run a mile at the first approach of somebody else’s drooling pet. I watched him on television trying to chat to a pig in a Gozitan sty, and I must say I wasn’t very impressed. The pig wasn’t impressed either: check out this link and see for yourself.\\nGonzi famously works through his documents at home with his cat wrapped round his shoulders. (I’m not a big cat fan, but I find dogs incredibly amusing because they have distinct personalities.) I can’t imagine Sant allowing a cat – or any other living thing, for that matter – to take up a similar position: ‘Tmissnix, jekk joghgbok.’ There is all that cat-hair to consider, and the road-kill headgear might be dislodged.\\nSeriously, though – whether people love animals, dislike them or are indifferent to them doesn’t say much about their character or personality. Hitler was a great animal-lover. Too bad he hated human-beings. The only attitude towards animals that says a lot about a person is sadism or cruelty towards them. You can read a lot into that. People who are kind to animals are not necessarily kind to humans, but people who are sadistic to animals are invariably sadistic to humans too.\\nSo let’s leave aside the issue of who loves animals more – Sant with his chicken-friends, or Gonzi with his Qattusa – and consider instead which one of them has given proper consideration to animals in his electoral programme.\\nLawrence Gonzi (commitments taken from the Nationalist Party’s electoral programme)\\n176. Work will continue on the animal protection centre in Ta’ Qali, given that all the necessary permits and calls for tender submissions have been issued, and the plans completed.\\n177. There will be more measures for the protection of animals, with increased involvement of NGOs in, among other things, the development of a centre of for animal rehabilitation and care.\\n178. There will be a training programme for animal sanctuary staff, and the programme of voluntary secondment of government employees to animal sanctuaries will continue.\\n179. There will be a micro-chipping programme for dogs and other domestic animals.\\n180. A rehabilitation centre for wild animals, such as tortoises, birds and dolphins, will be set up at Xrobb l-Għaġin and Delimara with funds from Norway.\\n181. There will be a foundation to coordinate animal-related projects.\\nAlfred Sant (commitments fished out from amid the misprints and computer malfunctions in the Labour Party’s electoral programme)\\n15. A sanctuary for animal welfare will be established in six months.\\n16. Hunting and trapping will be regulated WITH THE AIM OF SUSTAINING THIS PRACTICE. This will have to be done in the light of the legal obligations of the EU as they are interpreted today, but also in the best interests of the protection of the natural environment of our country. THIS WILL BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF OUR COUNTRY.\\nWell, the Lion of Change hunts in Romania\\nOnly a political party with a deputy leader who goes hunting in Romania would make one of the only two commitments on animals in the electoral manifesto a pledge to sustain shooting and trapping birds. And only a party run by I-hate-Europe Alfred Sant would put in a Great Big Escape Clause like ‘this will be done with respect to the geographic and demographic aspects of our country’ when committing himself to respect the ruling from Europe.\\nAs for Labour’s animal sanctuary – l-aqwa s-‘six months’. The surcharge will be halved in six days and the animal welfare sanctuary will be established in six months. What, complete with project over-runs of 250%? Or maybe he’s going to get I-switched-to-Labour-to-get-my-perit-warrant-without-sitting-my-exams Martin Debono to oversee this mammoth task, so that we might end up with something that took as long as the Bugibba promenade.\\nAs my friends down at Malta’s already existing dog, horse and cat sanctuaries have pointed out, Malta doesn’t need more animal sanctuaries. What Malta needs is a programme to teach people responsible pet ownership and the importance of neutering. Opening up more animal sanctuaries without this public information campaign or neutering programme is like opening up more and more orphanages under Ceaucescu and his ban on birth control.\\nHave you ever seen Clucking Chicken Sant being pawed by a dog? That’s right – I can’t picture it either.

For 15 years, this yapping poodle and his chicken friend have been putting great obstacles in the path to Malta’s EU membership, and now here he is, shamelessly dismissing those who wanted membership as the ‘conservative establishment’ – a phrase straight out of his socialist mentor Mario Vella’s handbook of grudges.\\nHe should be thanking us instead, because without us, he wouldn’t be where he is today.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 2:36 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nJason Micallef poses for the Super One cameras\\nOld Labour banned computers from the workspace because they took people’s jobs.

And in its long list of how to mess up education, the manifesto includes this absolute gem: a promise to find more people to ‘teach computers and informatics’.\\nInformatics. It’s been many years since I last heard that word, unless – hang on – somebody translated ‘informatika’ literally. As for teaching computers, well, I don’t know. I’ve tried very hard to teach mine to make me a cup of tea, but it just won’t learn.\\nChicken Run Sant isn’t mad keen on communications technology. He doesn’t own a television because he finds television annoying. He doesn’t own a mobile phone because – he told an interviewer – he doesn’t like the idea that people can get in touch with him whenever and wherever (‘Tmissnix, jekk joghgbok.’). And now we discover that he doesn’t know about Amazon.com.\\nI never knew chickens could read\\nAfter the famous university debate from which he ran away clucking through a side exit, his peacock friend Jason hot on his heels, Chicken Run Sant had this to say in his tedious newspaper column in The Times:\\nAt the end of the now infamous university ‘debate’ for party leaders, I was not whisked away from a side entrance. I just went there to pick up my coat. The fracas at the university was an organised partisan show of intolerance and immaturity, true, but it did not amount to a riot. I left from the main entrance, walked to the University bookstore and bought myself a book which I had intermittently shopped for over a number of years and finally found. Ironically, given what had just happened during the debate’, its title is Truth And Method.\\nLet’s leave aside the blatant lie that he left through the main entrance. I was there, and he did not – he rushed out through the back, Jason fanning his tail after him. What interests me here is Big Bird’s claim that he has been hunting for a book called Truth and Method for years. Jason the Peacock may not know about books and how to buy them on line, but it’s a safe bet that Joseph the Poodle does. So how come nobody explained to Big Bird how it’s done?\\nI logged on to www.amazon.com and keyed in Truth and Method. It’s available. All that the Big Chicken had to do was whip out his Visa and pay for it. Oh, please don’t tell me that he doesn’t own a credit card either.\\nTruth and Method, published in 1960, is the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer’s magnum opus. In it, he argues that truth and method are at odds with one another.\\nGosh, no wonder our feathered friend was so keen to hunt it down (maybe he should have got the Lion of Romania to do it for him).\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nL-iljun tal-bidla knocks on doors to drum up more votes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 4:28 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nL-iljun tal-bidla knocks on doors to drum up more votes\\nThere’s been a lot of fuss about the gay vote in this election, because – at last – more and more gay people are out and proud. The difficulty I have is in understanding this: gay people say they want to be treated like everyone else, and then they insist on behaving differently when it comes to casting their vote.\\nLet me put it this way. I don’t vote ‘as a woman’. I don’t vote ‘as a heterosexual person’. I vote as a person with a brain, with an eye to the economy and choosing the man best fit, from the only available choice of two, to guide Malta through the very difficult waters that lie ahead. I vote by looking at the two options and thinking, right, now which one has the best track record and which one do I trust most to do things properly?\\nThat’s all. I don’t look at issues like women’s rights or women’s problems. Anyone who knows me will also know I can’t stand this sort of thing: the ghettoisation of women. By playing the victim in need of special treatment, women are just running headlong into a trap. So I’m not a big one for women’s day tripe and nonsense and women’s pressure groups and women’s networks and all that kind of thing. Yes, I know that many people enjoy them and find them useful, but I just say they’re not for me.\\nIf you go around in life thinking of yourself primarily as A Woman or as A Gay (I hate that phrase; it reminds me of the fat Welsh git in Little Britian) you’re setting yourself up for a hard time. If you want to get into the mainstream just head for the mainstream – in 2008, whether you’re a woman (homosexual or heterosexual) or a homosexual man has nothing to do with the price of eggs.\\nVote for me because I’m gay\\nSomebody asked me, in a comment posted somewhere else on this site, what I think of AD candidate Patrick Attard’s article. Attard is appealing for the gay vote. Here are my views. If gay people want to be treated like everyone else, then they have to start by behaving like everyone else, and this means using the same considerations when weighing up the options on who to vote for. It also means that, if you are a gay electoral candidate, you do not define yourself as a gay electoral candidate. If this is your USP (unique selling-point) then obviously, people are going to ask, but what else do you have to offer?\\nI don’t see Dolores Cristina saying ‘vote for me because I am a woman’. We vote for her (well, I don’t, because she’s not in my district, but otherwise I would) not because she is a woman and because we want to have a woman in parliament to push forward women’s rights issues. We vote for her because she’s down-to-earth, practical and a good coper. When a gay candidate comes shouting into the arena that we should vote for him because he’s gay, then I must ask: doesn’t he want to widen his market a little more than that? If his only selling-point is his sexuality, then I’m not interested – not that I would be interested in an AD candidate, in any case.\\nGay people insist they are not different (of course they’re not, for heaven’s sake), and yet there are some who, like Patrick Attard, let the whole show down by insisting on using a different set of measures to the norm when voting or standing for election. When I head for the polling-booth, my sole consideration isn’t voting for a woman who promises to champion women’s rights and dignity. It’s a side issue, a minor thing – the most important consideration is the big picture. Let’s put it this way: what price women’s rights and gay rights if the economy is in a shambles, we’re being taxed up to the hilt, and somebody is picking a fight with the European Union? And come on, please explain to me what these gay rights that we’re so sorely missing might possibly be. If they are different to all the rights we straight people have already, then I have to ask: how come gays get more rights than non-gays do?\\nHi, I’m Tony, and I’m gay\\nBefore any gay man called Tony thinks I’m talking about him, I’ll point out that I wanted to pick a name at random and looked at my Staffordshire bull terrier, who’s called Tony. The mastiff is called Santino. He’s not named after anyone famous who’s contesting an election right now. He’s a Neapolitan breed and we wanted a Camorra name, so it was a toss-up between Santino and Gennaro. Unfortunately, not many people understand this, but I can assure you that the one thing this dog is not is a chicken.\\nI really can’t understand why some gay men think they have problems, that they’re being discriminated against or persecuted. From what I can see, gay men are always the most popular people on the party list, the ones that we all want to be around because, unlike the vast majority of straight men, they’re good conversationalists and make us laugh (and they take showers regularly and dress nicely). They’re also extremely successful in whichever career they choose, not least because gay men have far higher levels of emotional intelligence than straight men, who would like us to think they have none at all, and this helps them get ahead (women have the same natural advantage).\\nWhat’s the fuss about, exactly? Gay men are protected by precisely the same laws that protect straight men – and women of both stripes, too, for that matter. I see no gay men being hanged from cranes or lesbians being stoned in public squares. I don’t even hear anyone commenting anymore. The social pages of the media are dominated by gay couples, and the ‘let’s take a look at this person’s house’ magazine pages likewise. Malta is extremely accepting of anything and anyone that is neither black nor Muslim. Ironically, it’s a state of affairs that’s been brought about by the absence of divorce. When everyone’s shacking up with everyone else and having children in all kinds of extraordinary circumstances, because marriage is out of the question, nobody is going to blink an eye at a gay couple. Who cares – really, who does?\\nOut loud and proud\\nSome gay people seem to make a point of defining themselves as gay instead of just thinking of themselves as John, or Tony, or Catherine, in the same way that I think of myself as Daphne. What’s the problem here? I’ve just realized that many of the people I work with are gay – men and women – and I hadn’t made the connection before because that’s not how I think of them or define them. I just think of them by their names and their personality, just as I do with everyone else. It would surprise me to find out that this is not how they think of themselves, that they think of themselves instead as Daffyd (‘Hi, I’m the only gay in the village’) in Little Britain. And I’m quite sure they don’t think of me as ‘straight Daphne’, either.\\nThe gay vote? Come on. That’s rubbish, surely. Gay people need the same things that the rest of us do: a stable government, a sound economy, low taxation, high levels of employment, good career prospects, reliable education, the reassurance that no fights will be picked with the European Union, a commitment to the environment, and an atmosphere of freedom rather than of oppression and the fear of voicing criticism.\\nIf I were gay, I would never vote on the basis of some tenuous thing called ‘gay rights’ (please explain to me how gay rights are different to human rights). I would have more important things on my mind. There’s no point in having a government that’s willing to pay meaningless I-love-gays lip-service if you don’t have many pink pounds in your pocket and are worried that your colleagues are being laid off and you might be next.\\nGay men have a lot to learn from straight women. Straight women have been abused, violated, picked upon, molested, burnt at the stake, drowned, stoned, imprisoned in their homes, beaten, deprived of their rights and their freedom and even their children and their vote, since the dawn of history and most certainly before that. We have long, long experience of fighting the most atrocious kind of violations, and yet you won’t see a single woman going around nowadays and talking about ‘the woman’s vote’. Yes, gay men suffered too, but at least they could hide their sexuality. Women couldn’t exactly hide their gender.\\nWomen tend to be horribly practical people, despite some men’s portrayal of us as chicken-brains who spend our time frivolously shopping (I love shopping, but I don’t have a chicken-brain). We decide how to vote on the basis of what’s best for us, for our family and for the country. Gay men should follow our example and do the same.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 6:36 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Leader of the Malta Labour Party tries on a new patriotic outfit ghax kien hemm bzonn ta’ bidla\\nDedikata lil-mexxej tal-Partit Laburista Gdid\\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=aJL0SZOEf3Q\\nMinghajr apologiji lin-Normint u Jozette u dawk kollha ta’ Run Rabbit Run.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nSo we’ll do the talking instead.

The party has quite a good record of achievements in the social, economic and cultural sphere.”\\nSant on why, as prime minister, he raised electricity bills way beyond what they are today, surcharge and all, when oil cost $12 a barrel (it’s now $103): “We never talked about utilities before 1996. But we got into government and found a big mess. That was the situation then. It’s not the situation now. It’s a different ball game.”\\nSant on why he famously has no regrets: “Regretting one thing or another is irrelevant to how political decisions are made.”\\nSant on whether he considers his position on EU membership to have been a big mistake: “I don’t list that as one of the mistakes or successes. It’s something which the Opposition put forward and people decided. I have no regrets.”\\nSant on why he won’t answer questions about the future: “I don’t reply to hypothetical questions” – three times, to three different questions.\\nSant on why he won’t answer questions about the past: “The past is for the historians to decide.

Parental guidance is requested.\\n[Moderator – This one’s from me: Farzan tal-Bidla.]\\n  \\n\\n  \\nDavid Camilleri, who describes himself as ‘a proud member of AD’, sent me this explanation of why he is campaigning for the Labour Party to be elected to government. Yes, he is a real person, and yes, he is a member of AD – I’ve checked that out. For the past few weeks, he has been circulating aggressive emails about why it is necessary to bring down the government – Nazi government was my choice of words, but Nazi government was, in effect, what Camilleri meant. Read it, and decide for yourself.\\nDear Daphne,\\nHere is the “somebody called David Camilleri”.\\nWould you mind sticking to the truth? I have never ever written emails to people urging them “to vote Labour to bring down the Nazi government”. While I do tell people to vote Labor because it is high time for a change of the Maltese government, I would never ever compare the Nationalists with the Nazis.\\nIt would be nice, if you could apologize for that slander! But I guess you are so used to slandering people, for example Dr. Sant, that you do not mind badmouthing one more person. Your way of smearing Dr. Sant has reached levels that remind me of somebody who is foaming from his mouth like a rabid dog. Comparing Dr. Sant with Ceaucescu is so polemical, it simply defies description.\\nIn addition I do not have an “AD-Ghawdex Internet address”, but I am a proud member of AD, and I would be elated if Harry Vassallo would be elected, too – especially in regard of the campaign against him orchestrated by the Nationalist media only days before the election.\\nSincerely,\\nDavid Camilleri\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIf we needed any further proof that the Labour Party is completely intolerant of any form of criticism, and doesn’t understand the basic democratic concept of freedom of speech, this is it.

That’s the thing with the Internet, you see – they can’t burn the building down, so they have to find some other way.\\nIt took us about one-and-a-half hours to get it back on line again, after receiving kind assistance in shifting it to a different server. Meanwhile, lots of you called and emailed to see what had gone wrong. What went wrong is this: there are too many people about who don’t understand free speech.\\nSorry, boys, but you’re going to have to learn how to take criticism. No more burning down of newspaper buildings or sabotaging Internet sites. We can get the site back on line again, but the Labour Party you’re trying to protect ends up with even more egg on its intolerant face.\\nIt’s 2008, we’re in the European Union. It’s the Internet age. You’re going to have to learn how to take it. Who knows? You might even learn from it.\\nThis website, an idea conceived in a split second last Saturday and put into effect in a couple of hours that same night, has been a run-away hit. It is a rallying-point for those who are tired of the po-faced ‘I’m so balanced that if I criticise Labour then I must also criticise the Nationalists’ coverage elsewhere. Lots of people don’t think that way. They have eyes in their head and can see Labour for what it is: the party that hasn’t won a single general election since 1976 – 32 years – except for Alfred Sant’s brief aberration. The Labour Party scores one fiasco after another because it is wholly incompetent and cut off from the way things are done. No wonder they’re gearing up to go mad if they win today, and are already behaving like Madame Defarge and her cronies beneath the guillotine.\\nLet’s face it: those who can’t see that the Labour Party is a terrible mess and that the Nationalist Party is not, for all its faults, need some new spectacles. The Labour Party isn’t frightening per se – it’s comical, a tragicomedy. The fear factor lies in having a bunch of clowns and incompetents with their hands on the wheel. It would be like having Malta run by the Three Stooges – except that the stooges were harmless and these people are bitter, intolerant and vengeful.\\nIf they learnt as they went along, it might be tolerable to have to put up with incompetence after so much efficiency. But these are people who in almost four decades have made it a point not to learn from their mistakes. You can try to teach them all the lessons they need to learn, and they won’t take this information on board. Why? Because they have no regrets. So off people go to teach the Nationalists a lesson instead – how unwise, how short-sighted.\\nYesterday alone, 31,000 different people – ‘unique visitors’ in Internet speak – visited this site. Yes, 31,000. We started out with just 900 visitors last Sunday and since then, word has spread. This is because people have been longing for something like this, and to hell with the hypocrisy and skewed thinking that says politicians should not be mocked regardless of how badly they behave.\\nWe will continue to mock Chicken Sant as long as he leads the Labour Party, and if he becomes prime minister tomorrow, you can rest assured that we will have even more to say.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWe’ve just picked up one of my sons (no, not the famous one) from the airport. He has travelled right through the night and half a day to get to Malta in time to vote, leaving a conference in Denmark before the closing session. He had to pay yet again for connecting flights to replace the ones he had booked and paid for way back before the election date was announced.\\nHis fellow participants couldn’t understand why he was going through this. Why was he so keen to rush to Malta to vote? They were impressed by his sense of civic duty. He explained that he wants to help prevent the election of an anti-EU prime minister, an incompetent man who made a mess of running the country when he was given a chance to do so, a man who will do much damage to the country if he becomes prime minister again.\\nThen he showed them a few YouTube videos, including the one of the Lion of Change yodelling like a drunken peasant into a microphone at a mass meeting (‘Look, this is the deputy leader of the Labour Party’) and the one of the Chicken of Change screaming at the crowds in his best Hitlerian manner (‘Look, this is the man who might be our prime minister.’). Then they understood why he was ready to travel for 17 hours by train and plane, after paying a small fortune, to come back and vote.\\nHe also had lots of fun explaining how some people in Malta are trying to sell the idea of a coalition government as being a good thing and something to strive for in this election (‘What? Are you serious?’). This went down very well. Denmark has a massive problem with its coalition government right now, because a significant percentage of the vote went to the far-right party, and the far-right party is now controlling the government by default.\\nBut of course, it has to be Malta to want to fix something that works. Just like some people want to fix a government that works by throwing in a spanner called Alfred Sant.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nBaby, he loves us.

This is the gist of what he said:\\n\\nthe lowest voter turn-out was in traditional PN strongholds\\nwe cannot conclude that these were PN votes only (this because Labour voters live in PN strongholds too, obviously)\\neven if they were all PN votes that ‘didn’t turn up to vote’, the knock is still not enough to erase the advantage that the PN had over Labour in the days running up to the election\\nhowever, this trend of not turning up to vote may also be reflected in a similar trend of people turning up to vote against the government\\nbut then again, it might not – because none of us are prophets and we won’t know until the votes are counted\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nVotes have to be counted. There are no miracles or prophecies, not even with computers that don’t malfunction.\\nThe low turn-out and no-shows affected both main parties\\nThose who didn’t turn up to vote are ‘traditional’ supporters of both the Nationalist Party and the Labour Party. This information became available to both political parties over the course of the night as identity card records were checked. The no-shows were divided as follows:\\n52% Nationalist Party\\n48% Labour Party\\nThis means that they pretty much neutralise each other, and that the government outcome of this general election will not be affected by the no-shows, but by the votes of those who did turn up to vote.\\nThe identity of the no-shows also reveals a strong level of disaffection and disillusionment among traditional Labour supporters, who may have preferred not to vote rather than to go against the grain and vote for the Nationalist Party.\\nThis indicates that it is indeed a close call, and that Labour propaganda about landslide victories and majorities of 20,000 are just a pipedream. At this stage, only die-hard gamblers are taking any bets, and it would be unwise for anyone to make any kind of prediction.\\nThe Labour Party is already drawing in its horns – which it unwisely pushed out over the course of the last few celebratory weeks. The Nationalist Party has been circumspect in not giving its supporters any false hopes of victory, telling them the truth – that every vote counts.\\nWhere is Jason?\\nIf anybody spots him in public or on television, please report to this website at once. He has been nowhere to be seen since the day before yesterday, indicating that rumours he is ‘indisposed’ may be not far off the mark.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nThat wasn’t a chicken. That was a cock-up.\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nBecause the chicken doesn’t care which way it goes as long as it becomes prime minister.\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nTo hatch a plot.\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nThe chicken is not morally convinced that it should release that ammunition.\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nThe chicken has ordered a rationalisation and consolidation exercise and commissioned a scientific report. Once the commission for investigation publishes its conclusions, the chicken is going to renegotiate a new deal with Europe and will then streamline operations to set up the right framework for negotiations with the consolidated bodies to feed into a process of analysis that will be determined by the unions so that the road will be crossed efficiently. The chicken went to Harvard in 1979 and knows exactly what it is doing.\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nThis is another red herring raised by the Nationalist Party. What does it matter that the chicken crossed the road when corruption is lampanti?\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, March 9th, 2008 at 10:50 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nPeople are calling and posting comments that in the St Julian’s/San Gwann area, petards are being let off by Labour supporters already. Unless these Labour supporters know something that their political masters don’t (which is impossible), they are counting their chickens before they’re hatched. So ignore them – there’ll be enough fireworks, whoever wins this one.\\nWhy did the polling-booths stay open an hour longer?\\nThe excuse given was the build-up of queues at the booths, because of the local council elections in some districts. That seemed pretty lame to me, because other elections have coincided with local council voting, and the booths were never kept open. I immediately thought the Nationalist Party was panicking, giving supporters enough time to change their minds about not voting (difficult, given that some of them didn’t even bother to pick up their voting documents). Presenters on both political channels urged people to do their duty and go out and vote. Then I found out who actually asked for the extension on voting time: it was the Labour Party, which had noticed that lots of its traditional supporters were not turning up either.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, March 9th, 2008 at 11:00 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nProfessor Scicluna has just been on Super One with Miss Miriam Dalli. He made it clear that, unlike in previous general elections, he is not taking part in a vote sampling exercise and his comments are based solely on theory. As with economic exercises, he started from the premise ‘all things being equal’, which in real life they never are.\\nSo this is the gist of what Professor Scicluna just said:\\n\\nThe highest level of those who collected their documents and didn’t vote, and those who didn’t even bother collecting their documents, is in traditional PN strongholds. He reckons that the PN is the party that took a knock from this. (See my post further down – the parties were roughly equally affected – 52% of those no-shows were PN and 48% were MLP).\\nSo, if all or almost all of those no-shows were PN, this is enough to almost wipe out the Nationalist Party’s electoral majority of 2003 – again, all things being equal and nothing having changed over the last five years, which just doesn’t happen.\\nAll things being equal and the no-shows all being disgruntled Nationalists (my note – they’re not) this means that the PN and the MLP are starting the counting race with a 1000-vote advantage for the PN, or ‘rasimbras’.\\nThe protest vote could have expressed itself purely in the no-shows, but the no-shows could also be an expression of a trend – with more protest votes expressing themselves against the party in government (my note – if we are to consider this as a trend, then the trend would be evenly split, and traditional Labourites will also be voting against Labour).\\nBoth political parties will be able to predict the result from a sample of the first votes counted – 9000 are enough. With 25,000, they can predict the result accurately. But the parties are responsible and usually let more time go by before they announce the result.\\nThis is just a numerical exercise, it is not scientific, and these are only assumptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nJason Micallef has been spotted on Super One saying that he is morally convinced that the ballot-boxes contain an absolute majority (they don’t – because the ballot papers have been removed).\\nPlease remind me to ask Jason what kind of foundation make-up he uses, the next time I meet him.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, March 9th, 2008 at 12:23 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, March 9th, 2008 at 12:28 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nI wouldn’t want to be that santa tal-Madonna fil-but right now.

What good has it done to anyone? All it’s done is create a hell of tension and thrown the country into discord. So maybe Harry Vassallo and all those damp squibs and useless people he has gathered around himself are enjoying their role as dog in the manger. But they’re not going to be the most popular people around over the next 24 hours.\\nThis is the situation, and believe me, it’s the official position. It is exactly what was predicted by those of us who warned against the AD factor before the election.\\nNeither of the major political parties has won 50% of the vote. This means a relative majority. The Nationalist Party has won the majority of the votes, but the Labour Party, with the districts drawn up as they are, has the majority of seats. If AD does not win a seat, then the Constitutional mechanism which adjusts seats to votes comes into play, and the Nationalists form the government. If AD wins a seat, Sant becomes prime minister with a minority of votes but the majority of seats.\\nHas AD won a seat? No, it hasn’t. But with at least 600 first count votes on one district, before any official position can be taken on whether the Constitutional mechanism comes into play, AD has to be eliminated, even if it takes eight or nine counts. This is going to drag on for hours.\\nYes, the Nationalist Party has won. But because of those bloody people who were so damned keen to sacrifice the stability of the country to their own selfish ends (instead of staying home and filling in VAT returns), we are temporarily in a mess. They haven’t won a seat and yet we are still in a mess.\\nThey didn’t believe us when we explained this in great detail before the election, and now here we are: if AD wins a seat, Sant becomes prime minister with the minority of votes. If AD doesn’t win a seat, Gonzi becomes prime minister with the majority of votes.\\nGo ahead, all those who voted AD – pat yourselves on the back. What exactly have you achieved here?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe first count should be closed by 2100hrs. At that point, there should be some kind of statement from the Nationalist Party, possibly also the Labour Party, as to what the ‘official position’ is.\\nIt is highly unlikely that AD will gain a seat in Sliema – we’re talking here of around 600 first count votes on one district – but the Constitutional mechanism that adjusts the seats to votes will not come into play until this AD factor is completely eliminated. This means waiting until we’ve run through until the eighth count at least to see if the AD candidate has inherited any votes from the PN candidates. This will drag on throughout the day tomorrow.\\nAnd the country is in tension for another day, with a day’s work lost more or less.\\nOn the plus side, the Nationalist Party still has the majority of votes over Labour.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis site has had 115,000 views today. The situation is beyond belief. I am sitting here with memories of how it used to be in the 1980s, hanging around watching people count votes on Xandir Malta for 24 hours. Is this the democratic progress people were thinking of when they said they wanted change? Some people really need to grow up.\\nLatest news\\nThe Labour Party has been asked to concede defeat but is insisting on hanging on until the bitter end. This is despite the fact that the results so far show a consistent trend in favour of the Nationalist Party – around 0.4% or 1,200 first count votes over Labour.\\nThe risk that AD will win a seat is negligible. Yet we still have to wait until the party is eliminated from the equation, and that will be tomorrow.\\nSo now let’s wait for the Nationalist Party’s official statement at around 2130hrs.\\nMeanwhile, all I can say is that Harry Vassallo’s wish has been granted. In one of his last interviews before polling day, he said that he fervently hopes that this will be an election in which the country is thrown into confusion, with neither party knowing whether it is in government or not, no car-cades, and people hanging round the television for hours waiting for the result. Satisfied, Harry? What a perverse thing to wish for.\\nWhat were they thinking of?\\nWhen people cast their vote for the small parties, what was the outcome they hoped for? Did they hope for a coalition despite the painstaking explanations that told them no such coalition was possible? Did they hope to vote for AD and still not risk getting Alfred Sant as prime minister?\\nThey didn’t believe us when we told them what the risks were – now here’s the proof of the pudding, as Sant likes to say. The Labour Party has more seats, while the Nationalist Party has more votes. If AD had got enough votes to elect an MP, what we would have now is not a coalition government, but a Labour government with minority support. All you people out there who didn’t understand this before: do you understand it now?\\nThis election was never about anything other than the choice between Alfred Sant and Lawrence Gonzi as prime minister. You know in your heart of hearts which one is the better and safer option. Any other considerations were just so much frivolity and nonsense. People can only afford to be frivolous and nonsensical when there are no risks involved, and when they’re sitting comfortably. This is not the case here.\\nThose who cast their vote for AD, and those who didn’t bother to vote at all, almost certainly had a preferred choice of prime minister – and yet they didn’t bother to choose him. Instead, all those who voted AD and who didn’t like Sant at all acted in such a way as to help give Sant the government. This is called tactical voting – even if by default and unwittingly – and yet they deny all responsibility for the consequences of their actions.\\nThey damn us for criticising them, but overlook one crucial fact: that we have every right to rain down a shower of criticism on their heads, because their reckless behaviour risked putting the entire country into the sort of electoral crisis we had in 1981. They think that voting in this way is ‘modern’ and ‘European’ – but they are comparing Malta to countries in which no single party can form a government. And in this country, there are two parties which can.\\n“It’s not our fault the electoral system is this way,” they bleat like sheep. No, it’s not their fault. But the electoral system is what it is, and so a mature and responsible individual takes that into consideration when voting. Only the emotionally and intellectually immature fail to factor the consequences of their actions into the wider picture. Only the incorrigibly selfish think only of themselves and their own narrow considerations when casting their vote. AD people like to think of themselves as unselfish heroes, when all along they have been the most incredibly selfish and self-obsessed individuals. One of them is so self-obsessed that he actually believes he is above the rule of law and doesn’t have to fill in his VAT returns like everybody else does.\\nAs for those who didn’t vote – well, what can I say? Hundreds of people flew in from various parts of Europe and as far away as China, travelling for hours and even whole days to get here to cast their vote. My son was one of them. He doesn’t have to live here. He’s young and can up sticks and leave. He did it because he isn’t pigeon-brained or selfish, or somebody with tunnel vision. And yet others who are older than he is – others who are the same age as his parents and grandparents – live up the road from the polling station and didn’t bother to vote. Why? Because they don’t care whether the country is run by Sant or Gonzi? No – because they only care about themselves. Why didn’t they care, at least, about the many thousands of young people who crammed the Nationalist Party’s mass meetings because they don’t want their lives to be run by the man who tried to keep them out of Europe? Do people my age hate the young so much? Are they really that envious and uncaring?\\nI’m sorry, but these people are beneath contempt. What they are saying is that they are incapable or unwilling to make a choice. What they are saying is that they only think of themselves and the construction problems in their backyard. Get over it, will you? The problem with democracy is that WE can end up getting the government YOU deserve.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nAD has no chance of electing anyone. So that’s that, then. The Nationalist Party has known it has a clear majority since around 1300hrs, but the Labour Party was refusing to acknowledge it.\\nNow the Nationalist Party has agreed with the Labour Party not to make a formal announcement of the result before the first count is done.\\nIf no further posts appear this evening, this is because the moderator has gone out to celebrate.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nThat was a shout of relief. Oh yes, so that’s why Jason the Peacock has disappeared and Chicken Run Sant is probably holed up somewhere knocking it back and sulking.\\nLet off the fireworks! We’ve seen the back of these rubbish people: out into the dustbin of history with the lot of them. If I never have to hear the phrases bir-rispett kollu, korruzzjoni lampanti and bidu gdid again I’ll be more than grateful.\\nThe moderator is going out with his girlfriend now and I am going to take a hot bath and go out for a drink.

It’s thanks to us that you’ve escaped the punishment of having Alfred Sant as prime minister for the next five years. I hope the events of today focus your minds and put all your petty thoughts into perspective. How would you be feeling now if you had that Cowardly Custard as prime minister – a man who doesn’t even have the guts to concede defeat when it’s staring him in the face?\\nNow go and have some fun, everyone.

He behaved impeccably, like a real gentleman. Ahna t-tfal ta’ Stella Maris kburin bih.\\nL-iljun tal-bidla doesn’t understand freedom of speech, his ideas are extremely limited, and he can’t control himself in front of a crowd, giving in to the temptation to behave like the worst kind of Mintoffjan. But his behaviour in the night-time counting-hall, when the peacock ran off to seek the comfort of a mirror, his fellow deputy leader was seeking consolation in his bank deposits, and the Cowardly Custard was nowhere to be seen, Falzon carried the Labour Party’s burden alone and with dignity.\\nIt is not he who should be blamed for not conceding defeat until 0300hrs today, or for leaving the country in a state of tension until Joe Saliba’s announcement at 2130hrs yesterday. As he remarked into one of the many microphones shoved into his face, it was not up to him to concede defeat. He left it unsaid that though he was there to represent the Labour Party, as is one of the party’s deputy leaders, that task belonged only to his boss. And the Big Chicken was too chicken to turn up. Instead he was probably at home with a glass of whisky. And another one. And yet another.\\nPoor old Michael. Stripped of all the bravado of partisan politics, the promises of a landslide victory, and the arrogance that sometimes comes from being a Very Important Person in Politics, he came through as just an ordinary decent person shoved out to the front by a Cowardly Custard, a peacock and a notary who can’t wait to get back to working on contracts for large land deals, now that his ministerial ambitions have been dashed.\\nWeighed down by disappointment, he spoke without rancour or bitterness, and explained that the show was over for Labour. He went over to Joe Saliba, gave him a great bear-hug, then crossed to the Nationalist Party’s table and shook hands with everyone there. Then he left, keeping his chin up.\\nIn other words, he did Alfred Sant’s job and was everything that the Big Chicken is incapable of being. I can’t imagine for a moment seeing the feathered one conducting himself with an iota of that dignity.\\nThe spectre at the feast is gone\\nSome were expecting him to cling on (until he was forcibly removed). Others were expecting a shameless spectacle like those which followed the referendum and the 2003 general election. Instead, Alfred Sant called a press conference – or had it called for him – and announced that he had resigned as leader of the Labour Party, and that this decision was ‘irrevocable’. See the resignation press conference here.\\nIn other words, he is not going to allow himself to be tempted back by popular demand, as he was in 2003. Or maybe, his colleagues have just made it clear and plain that if he didn’t go of his own accord, they would have to kick him out.\\nThe Squawking Chicken’s behaviour contrasted mightily with that of Michael Falzon, who was loyally sitting at his side, giving him the support that he didn’t get last night. He had the expression and attitude of a furious brat who had been deprived of his lunch. His eyes were cold with resentment, his face set like a block of rigid ice. He was as shirty as ever with reporters and getting answers out of him was even more like pulling teeth.\\nInstead of being dignified in defeat when faced with reporters who were being magnanimous in victory, he was bitter and rancorous, keeping to election mode and talking about corruption, saying that he was at the disposal of the police if necessary.\\nHe still has no regrets\\nClick here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d8kaHwGZkM\\nWhen asked whether he does have any regrets now, he said, with an expression of defiance, that he doesn’t have any regrets about being honest and sincere – which are, ironically, the very two qualities that lots of people don’t suspect him of having. Honesty isn’t necessarily about money. Sant is disliked mainly because his politics are dishonest and insincere, but we no longer have to endure that now. He said he might have some regrets about ‘the little things’, but then refused to say what those little things might be. I don’t suppose they include a referendum result.\\nSomebody else asked him whether, looking back, he wouldn’t have said some of the things he did, and his response was: ‘No. Maybe I should actually have said even more.’\\nHe’ll still be a member of parliament\\nThe Labour Party now has no leader (it is rudderless), and will not have a leader until a general conference is convened and a new one elected. I can just imagine the long knives and the jostling for position, the lobbying and the slandering, that is taking place right now. All I can say is this: may the Big Director in the Sky deliver the party and the country from ex-Police Inspector Anglu Farrugia. We don’t need that kind of trouble.\\nAnd just in case you’re wondering, I think that Evarist Bartolo will be just as bad. He’s a snake in sheep’s clothing and strikes me as a crafty ahdar. Those Sliema types might like him, but they’d better pick up on the fact that he sure as hell doesn’t reciprocate the sentiment.\\nSant hasn’t resigned his parliamentary seat. He says he may yet consider doing so if it becomes an issue. My own view is that he should. Somebody who has been a party leader for 16 years, and even a prime minister for a brief 22 months, cannot revert to being an ordinary back-bencher. He will never have a ministerial role if Labour is re-elected to government in 2013. That would be ridiculous, and in any case, at 65 he would be too old.\\nA former party leader/prime minister turned backbencher is a bad idea. Look at the Dom Mintoff experience. Those who cease to head their political party should also give up their parliamentary seat, not just to allow the party to move on without them, but also for the sake of their own dignity.\\nThe power of incumbency\\nThis unbelievable man is determined to carry on with his catchphrases and buzz-words right up until the last minute. Now we know where he was all day yesterday: holed up in his gallinar leafing through his books and papers and trying to find some interesting concept to blame for his electoral defeat.\\nAnd he found it: the power of incumbency. Roughly translated, this means that the incumbents of a position like government have certain powers which those who are not in a similar position don’t have (gosh, you learn something new every day). To illustrate his point, he said that in the last few days before the country went to the polls, the MEPA processed lots of permit applications.\\nCome off it, Clucking Chicken. This wouldn’t have made a blind bit of difference, even if it were true. Let’s consider it in this context: Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici as prime minister handed out around 8,000 jobs in his government’s dying day, tacking them onto the public sector payroll and creating a burden for the taxpayer and a problem for the next government for years to come. And did he win the 1987 election? We all know the answer to that one. So much for the power of incumbency – but then we didn’t all go to Harvard.\\nAlfred Sant just can’t admit that he’s a hopeless loser, with a list of three general election defeats and one referendum hammering in just 10 years. He should have resigned 10 years ago, and it’s unbelievable that we had to wait this long for the inevitable.\\nEven though his ambitions are dashed, his hopes are trampled underfoot and he’s made a mess of trying to do what he wanted to do, you just can’t feel sorry for him. He’s too defiant, and you can tell that the main thought running through his mind right now is this: the people are wrong.\\nTomorrow’s events\\nAt midday, we should have the full result of voting. At 1600hrs, Lawrence Gonzi will be sworn in as prime minister. At 1800hrs, there will be a mass meeting on the Floriana Granaries.\\nThe biggest loser in Maltese political history\\nThis third electoral victory on the trot is a historical first. By default, it also means that the third electoral loss on the trot is also a historical first – and even more significantly, it was the same man leading the party in all those losses. The Nationalist Party, on the other hand, was led by two different men in its three successive victories.\\nAlfred Sant will go down in political history, just as he wishes – as the only party leader ever to lead his party to three consecutive electoral defeats.\\nSo let’s have a revised biography now, Frans Sammut. ‘Alfred Sant – il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is a little out of date already.\\nAnd the Labour Party had better do something about it\\nApart from the 1996 aberration, a government that collapsed after just 22 months, the Labour Party last won an electoral majority in 1976. This means that, when we come to the next general election in 2013, its only electoral majority in 37 years – ALMOST FOUR DECADES – will have been that Alfred Sant fiasco in 1996.\\nThe Labour Party has failed to read the signals. It has failed to pick up the messages. It has failed to understand that it cannot meet with success as the party of hdura, bitterness, envy and negativity. So badly routed and in such great disarray, how can it possibly hope to reform? Well, it will have to. If the Nationalist Party managed to reinvent itself post-Borg Olivier, then the Labour Party should be able to do the same, even if it is considerably less dynamic and good people do not, on the whole, like to be associated with it in its present embarrassing state.\\nThe problem with the Labour Party so far has been that it encouraged the belief, and was in turn encouraged to keep believing, that government is something available to both parties by rota. First it’s your turn, then it’s my turn. That is precisely how Labour supporters think.\\nOne of the main reasons they thought victory was theirs was because they thought it was their turn to have a go, and deserving power had nothing to do with it. Some foolish newspaper columnists encouraged this thinking: ‘Labour deserves a turn at government, even if Labour might screw up.’\\nHeaven help us.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 10th, 2008 at 8:47 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nJason Micallef takes up a new career in the performance arts.\\nJason Micallef was misquoted yesterday. Late in the morning he had a couple of microphones shoved into his face in the counting-hall and he told them: ‘Those boxes will reveal that there is one party that has the absolute majority of votes.’ He didn’t look directly at the camera when he said this, and he didn’t flash his toothy smile – though he never usually loses an opportunity to do so and even flashed it while his three colleagues were looking grim at Sant’s resignation press conference (you can always rely on him to behave inappropriate). Then he more or less elbowed the reporters out of the way, put his head down and moved off.\\nThat’s what told me that Micallef, peacock-brain and all, had a good inkling of what the situation was. All I needed to see then was Falzon’s sombre expression. He is certainly not a man who can hide his feelings.\\nMicallef was then misquoted or misinterpreted as having said that ‘the Labour Party has the absolute majority of votes’. The word went round that he had said this, with the Nationalist Party saying that he was irresponsible and Labour supporters heading for the streets to celebrate and let off petards and, in one case, a shotgun from a roof.\\nBut what Jason Micallef actually said, if you bothered to read him carefully, was this: the Nationalist Party has the absolute majority of votes. And he was almost right. Maybe he isn’t such a bird-brain, after all.\\nLandslides and avalanches\\nI don’t know where the Labour Party got the idea that it would win by a landslide of 10,000 votes. Some of its supporters were even claiming an electoral majority of 20,000 votes. Whichever way you looked at the situation, this was impossible. And the Labour Party, with all its surveys – which I imagine it did have, unless they were misprints – would have known this.\\nThe surveys I knew of all pointed to an electoral majority for the Nationalist Party of no more than 2,000 votes. That’s why I kicked up an incredible fuss at home and insisted that my son ditch the last day of his conference, and haul himself back here in time to vote, no matter the expense and the troublesome connections. The Xarabank surveys, which the Broadcasting Authority refused to allow on the show, indicated precisely this narrow majority too.\\nThe Labour Party might have had some kind of landslide with the situation at the start of the five-week campaign, but from the very start of its campaign, the Nationalist Party managed to claw back the vote. It continued to climb right until the end. The Labour Party must have known this, which is why Jason Micallef’s black circles had grown rather bigger towards the end, and Sant became increasingly bad-tempered and bitter with rage, leading to that explosion against Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando.\\nAlfred Sant blames it on the ‘lack of a level playing-field in communication’, and says that it’s his own personal belief. He’s right: he’s a dreadful communicator and Lawrence Gonzi is an excellent one. He has nobody to blame but himself. Some regrets might be in order here.\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\nTo leave the Lion of Change to face the music alone. So much for Labour United, the team.\\nCheck this video link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMy2rad5J5g\\nThe pigs of change are being BBQed\\nIn the parish square at Naxxar they are keeping up their usual tradition of cooking pigs on a spit in the street, to mark any celebration like the local saint’s day. The celebratory three pigs turning on the spit outside the Nationalist Party club have all been given names. Driving past, I could catch sight of only one of those names chalked onto the revolving spit: Jason Micallef.\\nMiss Miriam Dalli takes a break\\nShe wasn’t reading the news tonight with her usual semi-orgasmic posturing. She probably couldn’t bring herself to work up the enthusiasm. I can’t say I blame her. After all, her party had led her to expect a definite victory, and she must be very cross. Perhaps she needs a Bidu Gdid, somewhere far away from politics. She’s in her 30s and this is the time to break away. Otherwise, she might end up stuck on Super One news for the rest of her life.\\nThe Son of Daphne is no longer available on YouTube\\nOh, what an amazing coincidence. When news started leaking out that the Labour Party might have lost the election after all, the YouTube video of the Son of Daphne was blocked for viewing. By this morning, it was taken off YouTube altogether. The video had been posted there by somebody from Super One.\\nThis is such typical Laburist thinking. Feeling confident at the approach of victory and it-tern taghna, they start to hit out and attack those who they imagine will be vulnerable when ‘their’ party loses, left with nobody to ‘protect’ them. The minute they realise that it-tern is not going to be taghhom after all, they pull their horns in, behave like cowards and judge others by their own violent and vindictive yardstick.\\nPerhaps they imagine that the Son of Daphne will lead a crowd of thugs to beat up Miss Miriam Dalli and the Super One cameraman. They really don’t understand those who are not like they are. If I were the type to beat up anyone at Super One in the first place, I would have no qualms about doing it even with the Labour Party in government.\\nGypsy Rose Parnis\\nWell, I must say that his plastic roses worked. Silvio Parnis was elected sparat. That says a lot about his constituency. They’d better lay in a store of antimacassars for his parliamentary seat.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 10th, 2008 at 9:42 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nPandemonium at Labour HQ as the leader announces his resignation and everyone begins jockeying for position\\nJosie Muscat has resigned from the leadership of Azzjoni Nazzjonali. We don’t know yet whether the party will carry on without him, or whether it will simply cease to exist. It polled 1461 votes from all 13 districts, and not much can be done with that.\\nIt has Alternattiva Demokratika’s experience to show that even if it beavers away for many years, it isn’t likely to increase much over that showing. And anyway, what’s the point? Both Muscat and Anglu Xuereb have businesses to take care of. They can put AN down in their memory book as an interesting experience and move on – though I must say that electoral life will be much less colourful without them and, in particular, Muscat’s multi-hued tops and creative use of vulgar idiom.\\nIf only it were bye-bye Harry\\nHarry Vassallo has also promised to resign from his party’s leadership, but he’s trying to pull an Alfred-Sant-in-2003. He says he will submit his resignation at Alternattiva Demokratika’s next meeting, which is in April. But he also says that he will stay on if the party asks him to do so, though he would prefer to be a ‘foot-soldier’.\\nOh, I don’t know about this. He should have done what Sant did today – say ‘I resign, it’s irrevocable, and I’m off.’ It will be hard for Vassallo to find a role and an identity for himself after 16 years as leader of a political party (which never had a seat in parliament during that entire period), but if Sant can find a way at a few years older, then so can he. This kind of thing comes with the territory.\\nVassallo is not fit to lead the party in any case. We had that scandal just before the election, when we found out that his fines had been converted to a prison sentence and that he had applied for a presidential pardon and yet still refused to fill in 37 VAT returns. I imagine that lots of his supporters and perhaps even his activists were surprised by this revelation. That was a resignation matter, and still he stayed on, facing election as party leader with the guillotine of a prison sentence hanging over him.\\nFor the past few months, he has been coming across as increasingly delusional (‘we will win four seats in this election’) and these aspects of his personality became even more pronounced during the tense electoral campaign, with his repeated reference to the democratically elected government as a dictatorship, and to himself and his fellow party activists as persecuted dissidents.\\nIt all became extremely tiresome, but then yesterday he gave The Malta Independent some quotes that made him sound very much like our friend the Clucking Chicken. (I had already noted the similarity between various qualities of these two party leaders.) ‘The new government does not have political legitimacy, as neither of the two parties got an absolute majority (of votes),” he said. ‘It is clear that the population does not want to be ruled by either of these parties.’\\nOn the contrary – what is clear is that the population wants only to be ‘ruled’ by these two parties, and not by AD. Around 90% of eligible voters opted for either one or the other. That’s pretty much the population, if you ask me. Meanwhile, AD polled 3810 votes, which is 1.31% of the total votes cast – a mere 0.1% higher than in the general election of 1998. The much-touted Carmel Cacopardo put up a miserable showing, Vassallo was eliminated in the 13th count, and Arnold Cassola will be eliminated too.\\nAD had extremely high hopes this time, which led to all this talk about coalitions. Unfortunately, the party’s sense of self-importance became increasingly inflated. Talk about securing one seat somehow morphed into talk about being in government, through forming a coalition with one of the larger parties. But neither of the larger parties wanted or needed AD, especially because they don’t need more than 50% of the vote to form a government, but only a relative majority. AD’s supporters scoffed when it was pointed out that their promises to voters were just so much pie-in-the-sky, but now it’s all come out in the wash.\\nNow Vassallo has a fresh hobby-horse. Instead of coalition government, it’s electoral reform. The electoral legislation, he is insisting, must be reformed because although AD ‘won the equivalent of a quota’, it doesn’t have a seat in parliament. Well, excuse me, Harry, but AD didn’t win the equivalent of a quota. Quotas are on districts, and not on the entire two islands taken as a whole. If we were to take that approach, where would we end up?\\nThere was more rancorous posturing from Vassallo in The Malta Independent. ‘Both parties received under 50% (of the vote) and the result will only be clear when the last AD candidate is elected or rejected, and not at the end of the first count,’ he said. ‘This could have been avoided if the parties had decided to form an alliance with AD before the election. We could have had a clearer result much earlier in the day.’\\nLet me get this straight. Vassallo is saying that either the Labour Party or the Nationalist Party should have formed a coalition alliance with AD, purely so that we could have had the election result announced after the first count. What? Vassallo clearly needs some rest and relaxation.\\nAnd when he goes on holiday, he should take the party PRO, Ralph Cassar, with him. Cassar told the same newspaper: ‘The people have cut the parties down to size. The Opposition will have more votes than the government party, which means that we will have a minority government.’ Again, what on earth? As far as I can decipher the meaning of Cassar’s words, what he is saying here is that, taken together, the votes of the people who chose the Labour Party, AN, AD, Imperium Europa and Forza Malta are greater in number that the votes of the people who chose the Nationalist Party.\\nAside from the fact that this is the kind of reasoning that led Alfred Sant to claim that partnership had won the referendum, as a (pretend) politician Cassar should know that the Opposition is made up of the largest single party in parliament, other than the one that forms the government. It is not made up of all the parties who are in parliament but not in government, and it is especially not made up of those parties who received votes that did not translate into a parliamentary seat.\\nA minority government, indeed – when will these AD people give it a rest?\\n\\nA kind couple takes pity on the ex-Labour leader and welcomes him into their lovely home.\\n\\nLabour raises funds to make up the electoral budget deficit by selling catchy slogan T-shirts.\\n\\nAlfred Sant is feeling a little exposed after his electoral hammering.\\n\\nIl-Partit Laburista isejjah konferenza generali biex jaghzel mexxej gdid ghall-bidu gdid iehor.\\n\\nJason Micallef sits on the fence.\\n\\nLabour spin-doctors wish they’d known about this way to silence Sant before the electoral campaign began.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 8:53 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:02 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:03 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:03 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:03 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:04 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:04 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 9:09 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nNow that the Clucking Chicken is no longer leader of the Labour Party, will he carry on writing his PReposterous weekly columns for The Times? And more to the point, will The Times carry on commissioning them, when he is just an ordinary backbencher? Their only value lay in their being the thoughts – for what they were worth – of the leader of the Opposition. If his pieces were wholly cold and uninteresting when written in that context, how much more dead and irrelevant are they going to be now?\\nHe’s been at it for years and years with this particular obsession, which says a whole lot about him: starting each title with the letters PR. People speculate about what this could possibly signify – perhaps public relations or press release. I just ask, what for? It doesn’t achieve anything and it makes him look like a PRat.\\nIt’s also asking for trouble. If you are one of the very many thousands who can’t stand him, you’ll look at his efforts at coming up with new and interesting titles beginning with PR and come up with several suggestions yourself, like PR**k and PRuzuntuz.\\nThis nervous tic of his is just a metaphor for the way he does things in general. First he commits himself to titles beginning with PR, when he doesn’t have to do it and when it achieves exactly zilch. Then, as a hostage to fortune, he must spend the next few years trying to adjust his article to the title, instead of the other way round, which is the normal way in the normal world. It is just how he does policy – first he commits himself crazily and for no sensible purpose, then he tries to work it out with a bit of bazwar ‘l hawn and bazwar ‘l hemm.\\nI hope The Times takes this opportunity to ditch him without the fear of causing undue offence to a future prime minister. That way we’ll be spared of the nightmare of being reminded of his existence at least once a week.\\nSant is lucky that Malta has had a Nationalist government for the past few years. If he ends up without a job, he can find another one because there are lots about, possibly even for failed political leaders. He can collect his ex-prime minister’s pension next February and keep working and earning all the same, which will leave him fairly comfortably off, especially as his only dependents appear to be a few chickens in his backyard (yes, really) . And he can use his Maltese passport to live and work anywhere he wants to in the European Union, including his beloved Paris. Life begins at 60, Big Bird – so seize the day and go. Please.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nI heard rumours of his resignation, but they’re probably too good to be true. He’s probably one of those monkey people – the kind who won’t let go of one branch before they’re safely clinging onto another. So first he’ll find another job, and then he’ll allow himself to be forced out.\\nMaybe he can go back to plants, because they don’t talk back and always stand around in silent admiration.\\nAD TV\\nFull marks for perseverance, but sometimes you just have to know when the time has come to give up and let it go. AD has spent the last two decades hunting around for the miracle cure that will give it a seat in government. Now it’s electoral reform and a television station to get its message across.\\nOh come on. There’s only one factor that will make people vote AD, and it’s not electoral reform or the mass media. This is the desire to vote for the party because you like their people and their message and believe they can make a difference to your life. Not enough people believe AD can make a difference in parliament, except for the dreamers with their talk of coalition this and that – and those who are cynical about it are the ones who are right. You may get angry about that if you support AD, but it doesn’t change a blind bit of anything.\\nTal-pepe types who think like Lejber invidjuzi\\nAD’s stronghold, if you can call it that, is Sliema and Swieqi, for the same reasons that Bormla is the stronghold of the Labour Party. Why? It’s called identification. Sliema people identify with Harry, a typical Sliema boy (another one from the parocca ta’ Stella Maris). They don’t identify AT ALL with Carmel Cacopardo, and when Wenzu and Toni were AD’s figureheads, Sliema types ran a mile. I can say this with impunity because I too am from the parocca ta’ Stella Maris and lived in Sliema for the first 26 years of my life: there is a Sliema type that can be just as driven by envy, bitterness, spite and hdura as your typical Labour supporter. The only reason this type doesn’t vote Labour is because it’s too embarrassing to be associated with all those hamalli and criecer. The thinking and general attitude, however, is the same.\\nThis is a quote from a tal-pepe Sliema lady who lives in Qui-Si-Sana, militates against the possibility of a car-park there, has decided like her fellow-thinkers and against all the evidence that it is yet another Albert Mizzi plan to take over the world, and who didn’t vote last Saturday (not even for AD) despite the efforts of the prime minister to convince her otherwise (if I were him, I wouldn’t have dragged myself to that level and would instead have given her and those who think like her a few suggestions as to what they could do with their voting document):\\n‘You know, the thing that really bothers me is that these people make so much money.’\\nWell, at least she had the guts to say it, instead of dressing up her envious resentment as concern for the environment. With certain kinds of Sliema types, making money and being successful is considered to be as much of a crime as it is in Bormla. U hallini – I’m so glad I left the town because I have as much in common with people who think like as I do with Bormlizi who vote Lejber. I am happy to be surrounded by farmers because they recognise the value of hard work, link hard work to results, are more focussed on making the most of what they have than on what others have and are not rife with spite. Hence, it is not a coincidence that with the exception of one family, everyone around here identifies with the Nationalist Party and votes for it.\\nOthers didn’t vote because, although they are not worse off in real terms, and may actually be much better off than they were five years ago, they feel relatively worse off than their competitor, neighbour or associate, who seems to have more than they do. They vote (or don’t vote) not to gain more for themselves, but to break off what they see as the lucrative or prestigious connections of the people they envy. This is what they mean when they say ‘teaching them a lesson’. It’s not the ministers they want to teach a lesson, but the individuals who excite their envy. These are the people who talk about ‘arrogance’ all the time. By arrogance, this is what they mean – they think that some people are getting more than they are (more exposure, more money, more contracts, or more high life – who knows?).\\nTajba din – they refuse to vote for Gonzi because of a car-park, and don’t mind punishing the entire country with Sant as prime minister as a consequence. L-aqwa li m’ghandhomx car-park ma’ patatthom. You don’t have to come from a sqaq in Bormla to have tunnel vision, I can tell you.\\nAghmilna bye-bye, please, Arnold\\nAs for that Arnold Cassola – well, I don’t know. What kind of opportunist uses his dual nationality to stand for election in two countries simultaneously, deciding which seat to take up and which to discard (if elected), according to which is more convenient and possibly lucrative for him?\\nI don’t know why people take this man seriously, instead of seeing him for what he is. Imagine if he were a politician with the Labour Party or the Nationalist Party, and did the same opportunistic thing. AD would have a lot to say about that, but it’s two weights and two measures with them. They think they can’t do any wrong, not even when their leader steadfastly refuses to fill in 37 VAT returns, despite being given the kind of special treatment that others don’t get, then still demands a presidential pardon.\\nAnd excuse me, but where is AD going to get the funds to finance a television station? Donations from contractors, maybe? Arnold Cassola’s salary? These people are totally detached from reality. They appear to have no idea what’s involved in running a television station, and more to the point, with their leader’s cavalier attitude to money, they seem not to have performed a cost-benefit analysis. The exercise would calculate the required capital expenditure and running costs and overheads, and also the expected benefits, and work out whether the costs justify the benefits.\\nThe long goodbye\\nHarry Vassallo is in the newspapers again today, trying to come to terms with the end of his political career. ‘AD’s result was no shock to us. It was a surprise however, to those who imagined that even if they did not vote for AD, the party would have still somehow made it to Parliament. We were taken for granted,’ he told The Malta Independent. Oh dream on. This is just too irritating. I think what people have realised in this election, above all else, is that if you want X to be prime minister, and not Y, then you have to vote for X’s party – no fooling around with your vote. All it would have taken in this election to give us Sant as prime minister was 1,500 more navel-gazers. Thank God for all those people who flew in to Malta, voted for the PN, and left – that’s all I can say. We owe them a big one.\\nI think people have also realised now that a seat in parliament for AD can achieve precisely zilch, except an MP’s salary for the person who gets it and a reason for being for the organisation that backs up the person in that single seat. With one seat, you can’t legislate – and quite frankly, all this talk about ‘acting as a check on the rest of parliament’ is just so much unbelievably arrogant nonsense. Why should we expect an AD MP to police the other 64 MPs when AD can’t even police its own leader? Wenzu Mintoff had a seat in parliament as an AD MP for three whole years, and it made no difference to anything.\\nIn Malta, the vast majority of electors (at least 90%) insist on choosing their government. That’s not a bad thing, but a good one. AD complains about it, and attributes ulterior motives or pressures, but in this AD is wrong. Choosing your government is the wisest thing to do, because you have to live with that decision for five years.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 11:24 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis wouldn’t have been the case if Sant were prime minister today – but try telling that to the Qui-Si-Sana car-park ‘militants’\\nMarch 10, 2008: 08:51 AM EST/CNN Money\\nStandard & Poor’s (NYSE:MHP) Ratings Services said the parliamentary election results in the Republic of Malta have no immediate effect on its sovereign credit ratings.\\n‘The close victory of the long-ruling Nationalist Party, led by Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi, over the opposition Labour Party, headed by Alfred Sant, promises a continuation of the polices we have seen over past years,’ S&P said.\\nIn particular, S&P said it expects further gradual fiscal consolidation, a reduction in general government debt, and a commitment to enhance the economy’s growth potential and competitiveness, especially by maintaining wage developments.\\nS&P said Malta’s creditworthiness is likely to improve as the reforms, such as the ongoing restructuring of the traditional economic sectors and the diversification into new services sectors, gradually result in a more competitive economy with higher growth prospects.\\nConversely, the ratings would come under pressure in the case of sustained and significant fiscal deterioration, or if there are significant setbacks in implementing the reform agenda, the ratings agency said.\\nS&P has an ‘A’ rating with a stable outlook, and an ‘A-1’ rating on Malta.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe first letter is one that my husband, who is the administrator for the flat that the AD leader occupies as a protected tenant, sent to the offices of Malta Today, for publication.

There’s no other explanation.\\nThe Editor\\nMalta Today\\nMediaToday Co Ltd\\nVjal ir-Rihan\\nSAN GWANN\\nSGN9016\\n26th February 2008\\nDear Sir,\\nDr Harry Vassallo is correct in alleging that the rent laws need drastic reform as reported in your 24th February 2008 issue. His weakness, however, lies in his own personal status as a protected tenant in relation to an apparently unused apartment in Frederick Street, Valletta, which I administer on behalf of various mainly non-resident co-owners, and which he leases as an office.\\nWhen he launched the referendum campaign for Alternattiva Demokratika, way back in 2005, I had suggested that he renounce to the statutory right to renew the lease on the next renewal date, in keeping with what I perceived to be his principles. I met with abuse and arrogance over the phone, soon followed by a letter in a similar vein. My clients’ and my remedy, he claimed, was to sign AD’s petition for the rent reform referendum.\\nTo this day, I am unable to reconcile his position with his stated but clearly not followed principles.\\nYours faithfully,\\nPeter Caruana Galizia\\nValletta\\nThis is Harry Vassallo’s original letter justifying his position as a protected tenant, which followed an abusive telephone call made to my husband’s office.\\nDr Peter Caruana Galizia\\n56 Melita Street\\nValletta\\n8th July 2005\\nDear Dr Caruana Galizia,\\nRe 35/1 Frederick Street, Valletta\\nEnclosed please find my cheque for Lm105.50c being rent due for the above\\npremises for the period 1 July 2005 to 31st December 2005 and for the\\nbalance of Lm40.50c which you have pointed out as being due from the\\nprevious period. I trust that any inconvenience caused has not been too\\nharrowing for your goodself. It was certainly not my intention.\\nFurther to our telephone conversation this morning and to the last\\nparagraph of your letter of 7th July 2005, I must register my resentment\\nat your insistence on what you imply is my hypocrisy.\\nYou will recall that it was your goodself who advised me that the previous\\ntenant, my uncle, Dr George Vassallo had written to you stating that he\\nhad no interest in continuing the lease of the family office. You asked me\\nwhether I was interested in taking it up and I agreed to sign a new lease\\nagreement at which point the rent was doubled over the previous tenancy.\\nAt no point did I claim any right under the law to have the rent renewed\\nin my name. It was your offer which I accepted.\\nWhile I make no claim to being a perfect tenant particularly with regard\\nto punctuality in payment of the rent, nobody can ever claim that I have\\never availed myself of any right I may have or may have had under the law\\nas a protected tenant. I have never been asked to vacate the premises nor\\nhas any increase in rent been demanded of me. Much less have I ever made\\nany legal resistance to any such demand.\\nOn the contrary I have, on a number of occasions, requested you to state\\nthe owners’ price for the property only to be curtly dismissed since some\\nmysterious difficulty would make it impossible for the owners to agree. I\\nnow assume from your tone that you must have taken me to mean that I\\nwanted the place for a song placing my tenancy as a major source of\\ndiscount. I had nothing of the sort in mind and would have not objected to\\na fair market price. Indeed the long professional attachment to the\\naddress gives me an interest which other potential buyers may not have.\\nIn our telephone conversation you took exception to my mention of the\\nexpenses I have carried out in the premises in the event that I am asked\\nto vacate for any reason. You compared me to any other protected tenant\\nsimply because of the mention. The premises you rented to me were in a\\ndeplorable state: the plumbing and toilet facilites were beyond repair and\\nelectricity installations were of war damage quality. The fact that it was\\npreviously occupied by relatives of mine is simply an accident of history.\\nMy own relationship with the owners started when I rented the place.\\nAll the plumbing and electricity, fitting of a bathroom and a kitchenette\\nwere carried out at my expense. I have never asked you for any refund of\\nrepairs to the drains in the building which have been a constant toll\\nsometimes borne by me alone without colecting dues from other\\nowners/tenants in the building. I have paid my share in lieu of the owners\\nfor the replacement of the roof door and would gladly have paid my share\\nfor the replacement of the roof over the stairwell which has now reached\\nthe point of collapse endangering all users of the building. For a\\nsignificant period I covered the expense of lighting for the stairwell\\nsince nobody could get the other owners/tenants to come to terms over the\\nmatter. I did not bother you with a single one of these items. It now\\nseems to have been a mistake.\\nShould I be asked to vacate the property by the owners, I do not consider\\nit to be exploitative to have the expenses I have carried out taken into\\nconsideration. The new electricity and plumbing, costing a couple of\\nthousand liri would definitely benefit the owners since they are all still\\nspanking new.\\nMy principles, with which you make yourself over familiar without ever\\ndiscussing the matter with me, are that rent is a personal contract. In\\nfact it has irked me significantly that you have never allowed me to find\\nout who my landlords are and with whom I consider myself to be in a\\npersonal relationship. I deeply resent the thought that people I do not\\nknow personally may have some idea that I have been squatting in their\\nproperty.\\nThe absurdity of your refusal to sign the rent referendum petition because\\nof my ‘hypocrisy’ truly takes the cake, cherry and all. It is your\\nprivilege but if you are so convinced that I am happily exploiting the\\nrent laws in my own interest you should have hurried to sign up rather\\nthan become embroiled in nonsensical mental contortions. I am leading a\\nnational referendum to do away with the rent laws, all of them, including\\nthose that you imagine apply to my own office in Valletta and which never\\napplied to them as far as I am concerned.\\nYou may also take note of the fact that in its 15 year history\\nAlternattiva Demokratika has always been housed in rented properties.\\nCounting the very short time it availed itself of the premises at 35/1\\nFrederick Street, it has moved six times during these years. We have never\\nrefused to move house on request and the only instance of disagreement\\nwith a landlord was over an exorbitant request for electricity consumption\\nunfairly allotted to us and which we eventually paid in any case.\\nKindly let me know at your earliest convenience the names and addresses of\\nmy landlord/s with regard to my office at 35/1 Frederick Street,\\nValletta.. I do believe that it is high time that I find out who they are.\\nI also repeat my request to purchase the property, clearly at a fair\\nmarket price as was always my intention but which must now be made to you\\nexplicity. Should you prefer to wait until the rent referendum is won or\\nthe rent laws are abolished in anticipation by the government, I will\\nunderstand. It may also allow me some credit with my landlords who, I\\nexpect will derive very significant benefit from such a change and not\\nonly with respect to the humble premises I currently rent from them. I\\nwould also ask you to forward this letter to my landlords to clear up any\\nmisconception that may have existed so far.\\nYours faithfully\\nHarry Vassallo LL.D\\nAnd this was the letter sent in reply.\\nDr Harry Vassallo LL D\\n13/1 Triq Sir Luigi Camilleri\\nSLIEMA\\n18th July 2005\\nDear Harry,\\nRe: 35 Flat 1 Frederick Street Valletta\\nYour letter dated 8th July 2005 refers.\\nReceipt is acknowledged with thanks of your Lm105.50 cheque for rent on the above premises, being Lm40.50 due as balance on the previous instalment and Lm65 for the period 1st July 2005 to 31st December 2005.\\nThe experience was not at all harrowing. I have been dealing with tenants, arrogant or otherwise, for the past 25 years and can deal with all types. I simply would appreciate not having to send reminders for each instalment.\\nYour uncle Dr George Vassallo had never given up possession: he simply asked, following retirement, for the lease to be renewed – in his name, as “the office is still used by my brother Charles and Frank and his son Harry”. I was not comfortable with a situation where the person paying the rent and the person/s using the premises are not the same.\\nAs to the other allegations in your letter, I will simply point out that the lease agreement dated 24th February 1988 was entered into for the maximum period of ten years. Your retention of possession after 1998 has therefore been as a protected tenant in terms of Cap 69 and it is facetious of you to deny this. As you well know, the owners cannot refuse to renew the lease or increase the rent without the authorisation of the Rent Regulation Board, which authorisation will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\\nAs to repairs, the lease agreement clearly states that the tenant is responsible for all extraordinary and ordinary repairs, giving you a right to terminate the lease should these be felt to be too onerous. If the premises were in a deplorable state, it is purely due to the lack of maintenance by the previous tenant, who had been in possession for decades.\\nAs to my suggestion that you relinquish possession, I stress that this was purely motivated by the impression that you are not using the premises and are therefore paying rent for nothing. Your campaign for the abrogation of the rent laws has also, in my opinion – but clearly, not in yours – made your position as a protected tenant rather inconsistent with your stated principles, but obviously you find no contradiction in this. It is a matter of opinion to which we are surely both entitled.\\nAs often advised, the owners of the premises are the descendants of X. I am not authorised to provide you with a list of their individual names and you will appreciate that this is their prerogative. I will be advising them of your interest in purchasing the premises and also of your apparent willingness to accept an increase in rent and will in due course revert.\\nI trust this has clarified the issue.\\nSincerely\\nPeter Caruana Galizia\\nAdministrator\\nA further note\\nHarry Vassallo’s offer to buy the place should be put in inverted commas. The owners don’t want to sell. They just want the place free and unencumbered by protected tenants. Vassallo never made an offer because he wanted to buy it as an incumbent – using the line of reasoning that is used by so many of the protected tenants he is arguing against: you can’t get me out, the rent is minimal, therefore you might as well sell the place to me for peanuts. And in any case, here he is arguing that he can’t pay his VAT fines on Lm400 a month, and yet he’s offering to buy property?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nSuper One have put the video of the Son of Daphne back on YouTube (never ones to back down from a challenge, are they?).

Then the grim trio decided to release a statement because ‘the situation didn’t look like it was going to change and the party wanted to wait until the first count was over’ – you know, just in case one of the people counting the votes had accidentally sat on a pile of them and failed to notice.\\nToday’s statement, which was written in the usual obfuscating language, gave no indication that Alfred Sant stood up and said, ‘A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do. Take me to that counting-hall and I’ll concede defeat, shake a few hands and ride off into the sunset.’\\nMa’ tarax. This is the Cowardly Custard and his frivolous peacock friend we’re talking about. Instead they got hold of some obliging police officers and drove the Cowardly Custard under heavy escort to his home (‘ir-residenza private tieghu’) in Birkirkara. It didn’t even occur to these no-hopers and their chicken leader that the correct thing to do was to drive him to the counting-hall, go in there with him, and accept defeat as a team – Labour United – with grace and dignity. No, instead they got the police to escort each of them home (‘lejn ir-residenzi privati taghhom’) after they had seen Chicken Sant to bed fi-sieghat bikrin tal-Hadd.\\nThis was supposed to be a statement issued to explode the myth that they ran away and left Falzon to face the music alone. Well, if this isn’t running away (home to bed under police escort), I don’t know what is. Did the two of them have to run to Labour HQ to break the bad news to the mexxej, who doesn’t own a mobile phone? Of course not – one of them should have stayed behind with Falzon. Meanwhile, l-iljun tal-bidla was abandoned to his fate, keeping the show on the road alone, and then driving himself home without police to protect him from the hysterical masses.\\nThe final paragraph of this cringe-making statement: ‘Dawn huma l-fatti kif graw nhar il-Hadd fil-ghaxija u kull storja ohra, tigi minn fejn tigi, hija mahsuba biss biex taghmel hsara lil-Partit Laburista u b’mod personali lil Dr Mangion u is-sur Micallef.’ I wouldn’t be too quick to boast about the veracity of those facts.

These words were uttered by none other than Gandhi, the man who fought against the British Empire, not against erbat iqlafat ta’ gurnalisti who are trying to destroy what we are fighting for. Newspaper writers are such hypocrites. We have recognised the right to hunt and they have written against us. Such jealous and spiteful people! This is simply because they never managed to do anything worthy with their lives. Let me tell you what hypocrites these people are. France and England spend massive amounts of money on weaponry and they say nothing. And then when they see a bird dying they cry and don’t sleep – for a bird. We are not scared of them.

Were that to happen, the Labour party as we know it today would be all but finished. Change would definitely come about then. Starting from the leadership, there would be the clearance to end all clearances, notwithstanding that many of the current guard will be sitting in the House of Representatives. There would also be a fundamental philosophical and practical review of what exactly it is that the party should stand for, and how best to hammer it into a coherent strategy that would make sense once again for the existence of a party of the left, be it centre-left or a bit further out.”\\n– Lino Spiteri, The Sunday Times, 27 January 2008\\nIs it just me thinking this, or have the media gone strangely quiet after the electoral hullabaloo? It’s as though after the electoral rush, the tense campaigning and the announcement of the end result, there is not much more to be said. We’ll wait until the Labour Party holds its general conference, and then we’ll report it faithfully.\\nI’ve scanned all the newspapers and glued myself to the television and radio over the last few days, in the hope that my desire for news might be satisfied. No joy. There has been no attempt at analysis, either – not of what the result means to the Nationalists (apart from government, that is), and certainly not about what might be going on at Mile End. It’s as though a discreet curtain has been drawn over what must be long knives and pandemonium at Labour HQ. I have yet to read a single newspaper report or watch a television news spot – no, not even on Net – that seeks to wrest information from Labour about what in heaven’s name might be going on there. Are reporters going to wait until they are summoned and told the doctored version in one of those Josef Stalin press conferences?\\nI can understand the excitable speculation about the new government – we got the names last night – but I can’t for the life of me understand the indifference to what is happening in the Labour Party, which is considerably more interesting and of more profound significance for our future. This government is this government is this government. There are no big stories. The big stories, the secrets and lies, the jostling for position are all happening in the Labour Party. It is in complete disarray and having to come to terms with the fact that when the next general election arrives, it will not have won an electoral majority of votes in almost four decades – except for that brief Sant hiatus. And yet, there is silence.\\nAnd nobody has seen fit to point this out yet: but when Sant resigned, his two deputies should have resigned with him. They call themselves ‘the leadership’, and so their responsibility for this defeat is collective. Why are they still there, creating a ridiculous situation of a party with no leader but with two deputies? You cannot have deputies unless there is somebody to deputise for. That person has gone, and they should go too.\\nAs for that prancing peacock….out, out and out again.\\nAfter the meltdown\\nAn attempt at analysing the electoral fall-out gets Jason into another fight at Labour HQ.

And here we are – a brand new Bidu Gdid without him. It must be painful for the Labour Party, but they’re going to be glad this happened in the long run. It should have happened in 1998, though I’m glad it didn’t because we probably wouldn’t have been in the Eurozone or even in the European Union. So we have Dom Mintoff to thank for joining the EU and Sant to thank for joining the Eurozone, and now, finally, he’s water under the bridge and left for the historians to judge.\\nIf the Nationalist Party is going down in Maltese political history as the first to win three consecutive general elections with a majority of votes, then the flipside is that the Labour Party is also going down in history as the first political party to lose three consecutive general elections. And Alfred Sant will go down in history as the man who was at the helm when it happened – three times.\\nThere was a collective shout of relief last Sunday night. If you read between the lines, it wasn’t only ‘thank God Gonzi is going to be prime minister’, but also ‘thank God I don’t have to wake up tomorrow with Sant as prime minister.’ The Labour Party seriously underestimated how disliked and mistrusted he was as a potential prime minister, even by people who have voted Labour all their lives. The Nationalist Party haemorrhaged votes for a number of reasons, but those votes didn’t migrate to Labour. They just stayed home or spoiled their ballot-paper. They should have been rushing to Labour, but they didn’t. They should have rushed to AD, but they didn’t – only in part because they read the situation correctly that a vote for AD would increase the party’s likelihood of getting a seat and disrupting the constitutional seat-adjustment mechanism, putting Sant in government. That’s how much people didn’t want Alfred Sant as prime minister.\\nFear of having Sant as prime minister – which is not the same as fear of Sant the man, lest those who like sticking up for him rush forward to protest – is also what brought out the malingerers and the ditherers, and the ones who thought they were indifferent but then realised that they weren’t. By Saturday 9 March you could feel the tension in the country: ‘Allahares jitla Alfred Sant.’ Was it because of scaremongering, as that Evarist Bartolo suggested when he made a surprise appearance late in the campaign on BondiPlus? No – the Nationalist Party did remind electors what life with Sant as prime minister was like, but those electors had direct experience of him and knew it themselves. Sure, they may have been sick to the back teeth of the Nationalists, but as the spectre of Sant loomed larger and larger, the status quo began to seem increasingly more attractive (which it certainly is). And Alfred Sant was almost single-handedly responsible for frightening away the vast majority of first-time voters, who were conspicuous by their presence at Nationalist mass meetings and conspicuous by their absence at Labour gatherings. When the numbers are crunched, I think it will become clear that this election was won for the Nationalists by the zaghzagh who seem to have built a relationship with Lawrence Gonzi, a relationship which appears to be mutual.\\n\\nAD, with its voice and media coverage which are completely disproportionate to its size, colonised virtually every print medium to explain to us that it really doesn’t make a difference who becomes prime minister. This is where the tin-can political party’s credibility took a self-inflicted bashing. You can’t address intelligent people and tell them that pretty much either man will do. Even if you are a headless chicken you are bound to have an opinion either way. You might prefer Sant. That’s still an opinion. AD’s stance went down least well with its target market: people like me. As soon as I began hearing all that tosh about how it doesn’t make a difference who runs the country, the tin-can party hit a brick wall where I was concerned. It may not make a blind bit of difference to AD, but it makes a difference to me and to all right-thinking people. It didn’t help, of course, that AD’s motives in saying this were transparent. They knew that to get people to vote for them, they would have to persuade them that it didn’t matter if the constitutional mechanism didn’t come into play and Sant became prime minister with a majority of seats and a minority of votes.\\nThey even had the ruddy nerve to tell those of us who predicted this would happen that we were scaremongering and lying. Scaremongering and lying? Well, it as good as happened, didn’t it? Now that we have had that live demonstration of how we almost got Sant as prime minister with fewer votes than the Nationalist Party, thanks to AD putting its interests before all else, I hope its activists cease to feed giant fibs to the gullible of Sliema and Swieqi. The only one of them to come out of this mess with the slightest bit of honour is Rene Rossignaud, the AD Swieqi councillor who resigned because he could see what was coming and didn’t want to be part of it.\\n\\nAD’s principles are all over the shop. The party campaigns for rent reform while its leader tries to wrest a piece of property off his landlord for a peanuts price as a protected tenant. It scuttles about crying shame on others while its leader has a criminal conviction for which he demanded a presidential pardon – and then refused to fill in the 37 VAT returns on which the pardon was conditional. It calls itself the green party and yet had so little to say about the environment in its electoral manifesto that it was actually outdone by Labour and its computer malfunctions and misprints. At some point in the last year or two, the straightforward desire for a seat in parliament morphed into the obsession with actually being in government, as of by right, on the strength of this single and non-existent seat. The superciliousness with which AD approached this matter is, with hindsight, so infuriatingly arrogant that they should be put in the stocks of public opinion and pelted hard with rotten tomatoes. How dare anyone demand to be in government on the basis of a single seat backed by a couple of thousand electors?\\nAD has been around for 20 years, and in all this time, the only seat it managed to score was by default, when Wenzu Mintoff left the Labour Party while an MP, and joined AD instead. AD had a seat in parliament for three years, and no one noticed.\\nNow it’s time for AD to get the message. The market doesn’t want it. I may have mocked Josie Muscat for his vulgar language and his racist, misogynist attitude – but I have to hand it to the man, he understands that the rules of the market also apply to politics. If people don’t want your product, don’t keep trying to force it on them and cursing them for not buying it. Just shut up shop and move on to something different instead. With his quick resignation and his statement that he’s done with politics for the rest of his life, Dr Muscat demonstrated the ‘don’t throw good money after bad’ thinking that has no doubt made his healthcare business the huge success that it is. It is just a shame that he didn’t think this way before he returned to the political fray, when it was clear to most that the market didn’t want this particular product either.\\nThe much-touted Carmel Cacopardo failed miserably at the polls. Did he imagine that he would score a couple of thousand number-ones just because the AD coterie thinks of him as a whistle-blowing hero? That was a nice misinterpretation of the meaning of whistle-blowing.\\nIt struck me how completely irrelevant AD have become when I saw their three front-runners edging their way into the university auditorium for that famous debate: Arnold in an anorak and jumper looking like he was going fishing, Cacopardo in his batty-professor jacket looking like he was going to mark examination papers for some frightened students, and Harry looking like a 1930s spiv. Even to me they looked over the hill and past it, which isn’t surprising, given that they’re 10 to 12 years older even than I am. How could any 18-year-old student relate to them at all? The green party is meant to be young and dynamic, a magnet mainly to people in their 20s. It is not meant to be grudge-vote dustbin mainly for middle-aged and elderly people with some NIMBY problem or general resentment and bitterness. The attractive, charismatic and well-spoken Mario Mallia should have been leader, but it’s way too late for that now. It looks like the Nationalist Party is the only one with the ability to take seeming nonentities, wave a magic wand, and turn them into electoral heroes whom people look up to, admire and respect.\\n\\nWhile writing this, I still don’t know who will be in the new cabinet. I have my hopes, but can’t make any predictions. It would be stupid to do so anyway, given that the names will have been announced by the time this column appears in print.\\nThe prime minister has repeatedly said he is going to heed the electorate’s desire for new, young faces in government. My own analysis of the pre-electoral situation was that when people whined about wanting change, what they really wanted was a new line-up ministers and not the Nationalist Party thrown out of government and Sant brought back instead. Let’s put it this way: some men have been cabinet ministers for four terms of government – 20 years. However good they have been in handling their portfolios, this is no justification for giving them another ministerial position if there are other, newer names who are able to do the job well instead.\\nIt does put the prime minister in the dreadfully embarrassing position of telling somebody who has served him long and well: “I’m sorry, but there’s nothing for you this time. I have to put the interests of the party and the government first.” In private corporations and businesses, this sort of thing happens all the time, because the interests of the business are put first. But in a political party it’s different. MPs who pull in lots of votes also have lots of clout. This time, though, it seems that the electorate did a bit of sorting out themselves, choosing carefully from the list of what was on offer, and showing a marked preference for new faces over old. My own belief is that, no matter how good the performance of somebody who has been a minister for all or much of the last 20 years, it should come from him to bow out gracefully at this point and say: ‘The time has come for me to make way for others.’ This is the gentlemanly thing to do, because it spares the prime minister more embarrassment and awkwardness and it also puts the interests of the party (and the country) one serves before one’s own. If only more people thought this way.\\nThis newspaper column is published today in The Malta Independent.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nGod save thee, ancient Mariner\\nFrom the fiends, that plague thee thus.\\nWhy look’st thou so? – With my cross-bow\\nI shot the albatross.\\n…\\nAh. well a-day. What evil looks\\nHad I from old and young.\\nInstead of the cross, the Albatross\\nAbout my neck was hung.\\nFrom The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in which the character who shot an albatross is obliged to carry the bird hung around his neck.\\nI can’t imagine how people believe that because Alfred Sant said he is resigning ‘irrevocably’ that we have seen the back of him. He hasn’t ridden off into the sun-set. He hasn’t taken a world cruise. He’s still there. And that’s exactly where he’s going to stay – an albatross around Labour’s neck. He is not interested in the best interest of the party. He is not interested in reform. He is interested only in achieving what he set out to achieve 40 years ago.\\nThe particular psychology of the man does not allow him to let go of an idea, an aim or an ambition. He is obsessive. Observing him over the last 16 years, we should have picked up that much. He was prepared to sacrifice the interests of his political party to fulfil his personal desires. He was prepared to sit tight through three losses in two general elections and one referendum. So why is it now being assumed that he has had a snap personality change at the age of 60 and learned how to move on?\\nHe hasn’t. He may have ‘resigned’ – and I’m afraid I have to put that in inverted commas – but his attitude at the press conference was of anything but resignation to circumstances and destiny. Those who incorrectly read his demeanour as serenity and calm resignation have a lot of learning to do in reading the signs of non-verbal communication.\\nThe only reason Sant called that press conference to say he is resigning (or had it called for him) was to pre-empt matters and prepare the way for his survival. Even he knows that the party machine is not going to tolerate him sitting tight through a fourth consecutive hammering. So he mollified them by resigning irrevocably. Soothed and reassured by this, they will not object now to his continued presence among them ‘until things are sorted out’. This despite the wisdom nagging in the sensible half of their brain that a political leader who resigns is like a managing director who resigns: he doesn’t stay on in the office pottering about and keeping an eye on things. He clears his desk, removes the family photographs, hands back the keys, the company car and his other perks, and goes home, his relationship with the company severed completely.\\nImma tal-Lejber huma differenti\\nAh, but that’s not how the Labour Party does it. Alfred Sant is still driving around in his get-away Mazda, the car that the tax-payer funds for the leader of the Opposition – even though he said categorically at his press conference that he doesn’t consider himself to be the leader of the Opposition and will not be taking the formal oath. I assume he still retains his office at Mile End and all the trappings. I do not assume that he is now spending his days feeding his chickens and talking about literature with Frans Sammut. I assume that he is plotting what comes next.\\nPart of this strategy will be to anoint a successor and ensure that the konferenza generali votes him in. Creative means of persuasion might have to be used, like the letter making dirty accusations against Lino Spiteri, which reached the Labour Party machine just in time to put a rocket under his rival candidature in the leadership election of 1992, leaving the way open for one A. Sant.\\nUnable to fulfil his ambition himself, as he will not be allowed to stay on as leader, Sant will fulfil it through a poodle on a lead. This is unlikely to be the poodle with the ginger beard in Brussels, but it might be another sort – perhaps a compliant snake instead, a sly man with the outward demeanour of a tal-Muzew but the kind of personality that makes me fully expect him to start hissing in between words, like an anthropomorphic Disney serpent.\\nIt’s not as though we haven’t been there before. When Mintoff resigned, he ensured that his successor was a puppet prince. Then he stayed on in the backbenches, making his presence felt. Why do I get the feeling that the same thing is going to happen now? Sant might do it with more cunning and finesse than Mintoff did, but he is still going to do it. He has no life or role to go back to, and this type of character is unable to relinquish the aims and ambitions, the certitudes, in which his entire identity is bound up – not at this late stage in the game, anyway. Before this general election, he ignored three strong messages from the electorate and one even stronger message from the Big Director in the Sky. He is not going to ignore this fifth message.\\nSant will survive – unless Labour closes ranks against him\\nAfter the referendum/general election double fiasco five years ago, I wrote a piece in which I said with certainty that he would not resign, and that in five years time, we would disbelievingly find ourselves facing another general election with Sant at Labour’s helm. I lost count of the arguments I had with people who were convinced that he would go or be made to do so – but any psychiatrist would have explained that this was not going to happen. Please note that I don’t mention psychiatrists here because I think that Sant needs one – not at all. I mention them as the ultimate authority on personality, character traits and the prediction of behaviour based on those traits. Of course, you don’t need to be a psychiatrist or even a psychologist to work this one out. You just need to be a keen observer of people.\\nSo having exhausted his options as leader, Alfred Sant now intends to be a kingmaker and a power behind the throne. I don’t hesitate in telling you this: just mark my words.\\nFor those who wished to read them, he has put some of his cards on the table already. At his resignation press conference, when asked whether he would resign from his parliamentary seat and make a clean break with the party, he said that he may or may not do so when he knows who the new leader of the party is (because the new leader might wish him to stay on in a ‘consulting role’).\\nResignation by degree\\nThere is a more prosaic reason why he will not let go of his parliamentary seat for a year at least. He has no source of income other than his parliamentary salary, and though he has collected his Kartanzjan, he still has a year to go before he begins to receive his pension (a good one, as a former prime minister, but still a year away). He can’t live on charity for a year, though he will find financial support, perhaps through the determinedly loyal woman who he rejected two decades ago. But it’s not about the money, is it? It’s about wanting to die (of old age, lest somebody imagine I am insinuating otherwise) knowing he’s done what he was determined to do, even if he has already subjected the country long enough to his political fixations.\\nA credible resignation is one in which the party leader packs his bags and leaves, and not one in which he stays on, hanging about and meddling in affairs. And that’s why I just don’t find Alfred Sant’s resignation in the slightest bit credible. If he is managing the organisation of the general conference and monitoring the candidates, then he hasn’t really resigned at all. It was yet another mise-en-scene to throw us off the scent.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 14th, 2008 at 10:43 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, March 15th, 2008 at 11:10 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAlfred Sant fil-hanut tal-pets\\nMela darba Alfred Sant, f’wahda mil-famuzi dawriet li jaghmel gol-hwienet f’ din il-kampanja elettorali, dahal go hanut tal-pets u beda jitkellem ma sid il-hanut.

We bring you the first face-off\\n\\nScoop fenomenali – blufim ta’ Jason Micallef. Gwida Diocesana: H (Hazin)\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWatching Xarabank last night, one question kept coming to my mind. How did Jason Micallef get to be secretary-general of the Labour Party – the casting-couch? If he were a woman, we’d have suspected him of having slept his way to the top. I’m sure that wasn’t the case with him, but the man doesn’t have two brain-cells to rattle together. And he has absolutely no idea how to behave, what attitude to take with people, or even how to reply to questions and get Labour’s message across – if Labour actually has a message, that is. I don’t know what Sant saw in him, other than that he is an adoring and vacuous acolyte, a sort of pet peacock to go with the chickens in his gallinar at home.\\nJason even mimics Alfred Sant, though he doesn’t quite pull it off. Somebody says something he doesn’t like, and he squawks: ‘Bir-rispett kollu! Bir-rispett kollu!’\\nWhen a woman in the audience took the microphone to ask why Labour doesn’t ‘explain how it spends its money and where it gets it from, and prefers to pay the fines instead’, it was quite obvious what she was speaking about: the Labour Party’s steadfast refusal, like Harry Vassallo’s, to publish its company accounts or fill in its returns. This has been in the news recently, and much has been made of it – along the lines of, if the Labour Party can’t even manage its own financial affairs, how can it be trusted to manage those of Malta?\\nYet Jason il-pruzuntuz pretended not to know what she was talking about, even though everyone else did. ‘Bir-rispett kollu, I didn’t understand what you mean. Can you speak more clearly?’ And his interlocutor said, provoking bursts of laughter on my sofa: ‘Jien mhux bil-Malti qed nitkellem?’\\nWhat a prat – worse than a prat, a prat with a peacock-brain. And even now, under siege and in his hour of defeat, he still thinks that an empty smile which doesn’t reach his eyes is the appropriate response to a comment he doesn’t know how to deal with.\\nHe almost asked Anna Mallia about boob jobs\\nAnd then there’s the weird corner-shop response to arguments made against him and his party’s policies. Anna Mallia, a staunch Labour supporter and a niece of Alfred Mifsud, spoke very, very well (a round of applause from my sofa), pointing out that what she called ‘product Sant’ could never hope to compete with ‘product Gonzi’ and this was obvious from the start. She said that if Labour is to win again, whoever they choose as leader has to be better than, not as good as, Lawrence Gonzi. She said that the Labour Party needs a major clean-out and that it is in this great mess because so far, decisions have been taken to suit the interests of certain individuals who want to keep their position, or their job, and not in the interests of the party itself.\\nI agree with her diagnosis. A political party is like a business, and has to be run on similar lines. Even though it is not there to make money, it is still there to sell something – its message, its people, as a future government – and just as businesses have to be put before the interests of those who run them, so it is with political parties. The trouble is that those who run the Labour Party don’t have a private sector mentality like those who run the Nationalist Party. They have a public sector mentality, and it shows in the way they run things. The organisation itself comes before what the organisation is trying to sell or do.\\nThat squawking peacock pounced on her, and insulted her with her fleeting hopes of setting up another political party, instead of considering what she said and replying to it. ‘How long did that last?’ he sneered. ‘Twenty-four hours?’ I’m surprised he didn’t ask her about the plastic surgery she didn’t have. ‘How can I take you seriously, Anna, when everyone knows you had a boob-job?’ ‘But I didn’t have a boob-job, Jason.’ ‘That’s what you’re saying, but everyone knows – it’s like corruption. It’s everywhere. Everyone’s talking about it.’\\nAnother woman who doesn’t like Jason\\nSharon Ellul Bonici – she who made a career out of trying to keep Malta out of the EU, and who promptly rushed off to Brussels when Malta joined, to make her life there – laid into Jason for the fact that she was chucked out of the Labour Party for taking part in a march in favour of referendums on the Lisbon Treaty, in Strasbourg. She had received a letter from Labour’s Board of Vigilance and Discipline. What a party, eh – one that doesn’t even allow its members to espouse their right to freedom of assembly.\\nMaybe the Labour Party should start by asking itself why the Nationalist Party doesn’t have a Board of Vigilance and Discipline. It’s not because its members can be relied on to behave themselves. They don’t behave themselves. It’s because a board like that is Stalinist in essence. It doesn’t have a part to play in the modern world.\\nJason is threatened by the idea of George Abela\\nThen a clip interview with George Abela was shown. He said that he is prepared to be at the service of the Labour Party. Because this is just what many people are hoping will happen, Jason was not amused. Well, nobody ever claimed that peacocks have a sense of humour. A sense of humour is dependent on intelligence.\\nHe laid into Abela, squawking that Labour delegates will never forgive him for abandoning the party in the middle of the 1998 electoral campaign. Then Pierre Portelli tal-PN laid into Jason, telling him that he should resign immediately for taking a public stand on a leadership contender, when he is secretary-general and is in duty bound to be impartial. Jason’s response? Stretching his lips to reveal his teeth.\\nGeorge Abela, like several others have done already, said that the Labour Party’s leadership election rules have to change. This is now an open society, and leaders can’t be elected directly by the delegates. It doesn’t make sense to put all that responsibility on their shoulders. ‘This is a choice that affects not just the future of the party, but also the future of the country,’ he said. Bully to that.\\nCharlon is still in campaign mode\\nJoe Saliba put in to remark that the Nationalist Party, far from scraping a ‘narrow victory’, had actually pulled off a tremendous feat. Tell me about it: at the start of the campaign, the Labour Party was leading by around 15,000 votes. No wonder they got stuck at that stage mentally, and went around telling their supporters that it would be a landslide victory. It would have, yes, hadn’t it been for the phenomenal success of the Nationalist Party’s multi-pronged campaign, which pulled in thousands of votes every week. ‘We ran after every vote,’ Saliba said. Yes, they did. Even Lawrence Gonzi was knocking on doors at the end – and now here are the Labour ‘liderxipp’, rejecting people and telling them that they’re not wanted if they criticise.\\nCharlon Gouder (ghaliex ma jmurx jinheba) took the microphone into his hands and immediately began to behave like he did in the campaign, firing off accusations. I almost expected him to ask Joe Saliba whether he is saying that Sant is a corrupt liar. Saliba merely told him that some humility would be in order, now that the Labour Party is well and truly routed, and faces such deep problems.\\nAnna Mallia reminds them about the computer malfunctions\\nAnna Mallia put in again, to ask what on earth the Labour Party might have been doing in these past five years, when it couldn’t even put an electoral programme together without noticing that several things in it had already been done by the Nationalist Party, some of them years ago. Jason’s reaction? Oh, you’ve guessed it – straight out of the Cheshire cat’s book of etiquette. ‘It’s embarrassing,’ Mallia said. ‘No wonder there are first-time voters who have grown up in Labour families, but who are too ashamed to be associated with the Labour Party, or even to vote for it.’\\nJason decided it was time to speak instead of smile. He said that one of the Labour Party’s stances ‘giet vindicted.’ In one of his chicken experiments, he must have mated ‘vindictive’ with ‘vindicated’ and come up with a mutant word that means a bit of both.\\nOh, and he was wearing those brown casual shoes again with his dark suit – only this time they weren’t even matched to his tie. Will somebody please buy the man a pair of formal black leather lace-ups, please? Looking at those ill-shod feet just sets my teeth on edge.\\nAjma, hej – ara min se jiddeffess issa\\nThen we had a clip with Anglu Farrugia, the former police inspector in Lorry Pullicino’s force who thinks he will make a good prime minister, the kind who can mingle with heads of state and make a great impression. So help us God.\\nJust as he thought that the Freeport engages people by getting its human resources department to take bribes through a thug intermediary (legacy from his party’s past), so he believes that the Nationalist Party won the election by buying votes. ‘Money was used to persuade people to vote PN,’ said this brilliant bulb in Labour’s chandelier. U mur saqqi l-hass.\\nAnd Alfred Mifsud is back in the game\\nIn a newspaper article a few days ago, Alfred Mifsud – who also wants to be a contender (why does that bring Marlon Brando to mind? ‘I couldah bin ah contendah.’) – remarked quite pointedly that the people didn’t trust the Labour Party for a variety of reasons. One of these is that sensible people were nervous about having the government’s dealings with the EU in the hands of those who, before the referendum just five years ago, were saying ‘Alla hares Malta tissieheb mal-Unjoni Ewropeja.’ Too right – and there’s more.\\nCall in Comtec and gas the roaches\\nThe Labour Party cannot pick as a leader anyone who is tainted with its past. That’s the foremost problem it has to deal with right now. It has to run through Mile End with the fumigators and get rid of everything and everyone associated with the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and even with the Santian years of 2000-2008. This means that there will be hardly anyone left, because Sant systematically erased anyone who opposed him.\\nYet the Malta Labour Party has to do what the British Labour Party did, after it was routed and in opposition for almost two decades. It has to get rid of the past if it is to have a future. The British Labour Party got itself a leader and frontrunners modelled on the Conservative Party, and ended up beating the Conservatives at their own game. The days of ‘worker politics’ are over, because everyone is aspirational now.\\nAnd here is some free advice to Lejber – not that they’ll take it, even though they’re aware that I know exactly what I’m talking about. They won’t get anywhere, and they won’t be able to move on, unless they make a full and formal apology for what they did in the 1970s and 1980s, for ruining people’s lives, for putting the country into crisis, and for leaving whole generations of young people without hope or prospects.\\nWe want to see them grovel and scrape. We want to hear them say that they’re sorry they caused us so much suffering. We want to know that they understand that the reason we hate them now is because they hated us then and treated human-beings like worthless dirt. And we can’t and won’t forgive them until they say it. When Sant said ‘no regrets’ this time, he hammered another 10 nails into Labour’s coffin. How dare the Labour Party insult us by saying something like that? No regrets for what they did to us? No regrets for trying so hard to lock us out of the EU? I have to conclude that they are all raging, raving lunatics who can’t pick up the public mood or even the seriousness of the disaster they brought on the country in the 1970s and the 1980s, and the even greater disaster they tried so hard to wreak by keeping Malta out of Europe.\\nAlla hares jitla l-Lejber\\nLabour might have failed to pick up the mood and the messages from voters in the last two weeks of the campaign, but I didn’t. The atmosphere was one of absolute terror that Labour might be elected – Alla hares jitla l-Lejber. The correspondence pages of The Times, the postings on this blog, the conversations of people – all were dominated by tales of past experiences under Labour in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nLabour supporters dismiss this as an obsession (well, they would, wouldn’t they?), and say that we should get over it because it’s the past. How easy it is to be so cavalier about other people’s pain and suffering. Apologising for causing it is a whole lot more difficult. The wound is still open, still bleeding, even after all this time, and it won’t heal without reconciliation – and reconciliation is dependent on sorrow for the pain caused. Every time there is an election, the wound begins to ache and fester again.\\nLabour cannot lay the pain to rest by giving us a couple of tablets and telling us to forget it.\\nLast Saturday’s general election was lost in 1984.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIf more proof were needed that the Labour Party doesn’t understand the important role played by criticism, here it is. Alfred Mifsud has reminded us today (in a report in The Times) that in 2003 the party’s Board of Vigilance and Discipline (the name alone is enough) had give him a formal warning after he wrote newspaper articles that criticized the Labour Party, Alfred Sant, and his decision to stay on following all those defeats. This warning more or less expelled him from the party for the grave misdemeanour of telling it what was wrong with it.\\nNo wonder Labour can’t reform, and will have won only one electoral majority of votes in almost four decades by the time we get to the next general election. With this Josef Stalin approach to its internal and external politics, it is dead in the water.\\nNow Alfred Mifsud wants to return to the fold, though he is not committing himself publicly to whether he will be in the electoral race or not. But to return to the fold, he has to have somebody open the gate. So he has written to the people who warned him to ask them to take him back, now that Sant is no longer a deterrent (ah, but he is).\\n“Time has proven me right,” Alfred Mifsud told The Times. “It is now clear that I was not at all trying to damage the party but was trying to avert more damage. I have now asked the board to reconsider the warning it had issued. After that, we’ll see.” In his position, I would have told them where to stuff their warning, and wouldn’t have gone back on it. But the Labour Party needs his in-put so maybe he’s right to eat humble pie and beg forgiveness. I don’t know. To me, it just says a hell of a lot about what’s wrong with Labour that it has this kind of ‘vigilance and discipline’ board to police internal criticism and dissent.\\nPariahs and outcasts\\nIf the Labour Party considers all those who criticize it constructively to be pariahs and outcasts, or ‘helping the other side’, then the party just hasn’t entered the post-Stalin age and can’t function in 2008 (as though we needed more proof of that). I have spent the past four years tearing the Nationalist Party, government and senior figures to shreds for a variety of reasons, but that hasn’t made me a pariah to the party, and some of my criticism might actually have been taken on board. It is because the Nationalist Party is forever listening and monitoring, changing and evolving, that it has survived so well and is nothing like the Nationalist Party of 30 or 40 years ago. Labour, on the other hand, has remained unchanged. True, I am not a politician like Alfred Mifsud, only a newspaper columnist. But I can’t imagine that if a Labour-supporting newspaper columnist were to criticize the Labour Party on a regular basis and on matters that deserve criticism, she would ever have a hope of entering Mile End again, unless it is under police escort.\\nI agree wholeheartedly with Alfred Mifsud (and also with Dominic Fenech, who wrote in a similar vein in L-orizzont a couple of days ago) that the Labour Party should now choose its leader carefully, and not in a rush to fill the gap. Labour should learn the lessons of Maltese political history, more particularly those taught by the istory of the Nationalist Party over the last three decades: that it almost doesn’t matter what the party is like, because you can only swing it when you have a brilliant and charismatic leader, the kind who magnetizes crowds and inspires audiences with hope and faith in their future. The Nationalist Party managed to produce the man for the moment in 1981 and again in 2004. Each time, the person chosen first came across as a nonentity, and then evolved into a powerfully compelling figure. That’s really because what is needed in a situation like this is a relatively unknown person who can be shaped, moulded and allowed to grow into the person to suit the times. The last thing a political party needs is a new leader who is a known and disliked face already. People fall into the trap of mentioning such contenders for the leadership, but they really are non-starters. Joseph Muscat? Evarist Bartolo? Marie Louise Coleiro? Anglu Farrugia? Oh sure – that will really help Nationalist supporters to relax in 2013. I hope the Labour Party isn’t going to make the signal error, once more, of choosing a ‘Labour leader’ rather than a Maltese prime minister.\\nAlfred Mifsud had more to say, but I get the feeling that he will be ignored by the ostriches with their heads in the sand (so many birds – chickens, peacocks, albatrosses, ostriches – so little time!). “The party should be open to people outside as well as within – Labour supporters and the electorate in general,” he said. “The problem with the 2003 decision to reappoint Dr Sant after he had been rejected in the general election was that the decision defied the electorate, which is why Labour is in the position it is in today.” Damned right – but the main problem I can see now is that Labour has nothing to choose from. All the names being bandied about are no-hopers and non-starters. True, Labour can try to work the magic like the Nationalist Party did so successfully, but the starting-point is good raw material. And it just isn’t there.\\nWhen choosing a party leader, Labour – and the rest of us – must picture this person as a prime minister, sitting in the prime ministerial chair and doing prime ministerial things, meeting other prime ministers and having prime ministerial discussions. A Labour leader isn’t just a Labour leader. We may have forgotten this fact due to the party’s absence from government for so long, but he or she is also a would-be prime minister. The moment you see the contenders in this context, they fall at the first hurdle. They just don’t have what it takes, nor will they ever do so, no matter how many magic wands are waved. It takes more than a magic wand to command respect.\\nHurry up, Harry – and go\\nHarry Vassallo thinks he has won the election because AD’s votes added to those of the Labour Party together exceed those of the party that is governing. He calls it ‘a minority government’. His foot-soldiers are currently engaged in spinning this all over the Internet as the latest AD buzz-phrase, to replace ‘coalition works’ and ‘single-party dictatorship’.\\nHow tiresome they are. It is like hearing somebody forever nagging in the background or yapping on the sidelines, trying to prove a fatuous point. Given AD’s reasoning, a government is a ‘minority government’ if the party scores less than 50% of votes cast. Some of them are even saying that it does not represent the people of Malta, because taken together there were more who didn’t vote, who voted Labour or for AD, Norman Lowell or AN. With this kind of creative accounting, they should be filling in the boss’s VAT returns. Instead, they sound like Alfred Sant explaining to us why partnership won the referendum.\\nTo render more palatable the fact that he has wasted the best part of his life, just as Alfred Sant has done, Harry Vassallo is going through the psychological process of rewriting ‘the narrative’ in his mind. Unfortunately, he is also writing it on his keyboard and emailing it to The Times for publication. Some of it appeared the day before yesterday. I have no doubt there will be lots more.\\nApparently, the Greens increased their support by ‘nearly 100 per cent’ since the 2003 general election, despite scoring only 3,810 votes from all 13 districts in this one. I’ve tried punching the buttons on my calculator all kinds of ways, but I still can’t work this one out. As one man advised an AD activist who had been haranguing over the Internet with this kind of reasoning that 3,810 votes taken all over Malta is ‘a quota’, AD’s only hope now is to issue a directive to all its 3,810 supporters to go and live in Sliema.\\nHarry is ever so cross because TVM reported his resignation with those of Alfred Sant the thrice-defeated Labour leader and Josie Muscat ‘shaking the dust off his sandals.’ But for ‘the Greens’ – sorry, Harry, but the last time I looked, the party was called Alternattiva Demokratika, and that’s how it was listed on my ballot-sheet – it wasn’t a defeat at all. Oh no. It was a victory. Harry is still ‘fighting fit’ because he has given his ‘giant adversaries a tremendous run for their money’. Another ostrich, I see: no Harry, you didn’t give the parties a run for their money, you put the 140,000-plus electors who voted for the Nationalist Party into a state of high tension, and you won’t be forgiven easily for doing so.\\nBut Harry doesn’t see this, and if he does, then he doesn’t mind. He clearly thinks of himself as a heroic figure not just in his own mind but also in reality. Some of his statements are beginning to seem increasingly delusional, like extracts from the Diary of Adrian Mole by Sue Townsend. Just read this piece from his victory panegyric last Friday: “Life is about living and Greens live gloriously. What a fight it has been! What a glorious fight. There are 3,810 of us who have been confirmed resilient to fear and propaganda blatant and subliminal. Perhaps I was born a snob” – yes, Harry, I’m afraid you were, are and will forever be one, and that’s the main source of your problems: the combination of a superiority complex with an absence of skill, talent and ability – “but I am grinning with pride in being Green. The few we are and the more massive the hysteria, the taller I stand. Ninety-eight point seven per cent of the voting population may take offence at it, but I find it hard to hide my satisfaction in not being counted among them. My bond with our splendid core support is unbreakable. What rare, terrific people they are!”\\nWell, if they’re so rare and terrific, get a team of them to fill in your VAT returns so that you can get that presidential pardon you were after.\\nAh, but there’s more. Harry tells us that he spent the last 36 years of his life ‘in Opposition’, but he fails to explain how that might be, given that he never had a seat on either side of the house. I suppose what he means is that he segued from being against the Labour government between 1971 and 1987 to being against the Nationalist government between 1987 and 2008, and that he was against the Labour government again between 1996 and 1998. Coming from somebody who is claiming victory in this election with 1.8% of the vote, nothing surprises me.\\nLabour buys Harry a few drinks\\nIn one of my columns just before the general election, I quoted an extract from Herbert Ganado’s Rajt Malta Tinbidel, in which he describes how he and Robby Borg Olivier bought Mabel some drinks after the general election that followed the collapse of the unworkable coalition government of 1953. The Nationalists got into government in that election because of a scenario similar to what we almost had last Sunday, when there was the possibility of Labour getting into government on a minority of votes and a majority of seats because of AD. In that election, the Nationalists won by default. Because of the ‘third party’ factor put up by the Constitutional Party, Mintoff’s Labour Party got the majority of votes while the Nationalist Party got the majority of seats – and the government. And that is why they bought Mabel Strickland rounds of drinks – though in those straitened times it was more likely to have been a thimbleful of sherry.\\nI recalled this passage from the book when I read Harry Vassallo’s description of history repeating itself last Friday. He had parked by the Naxxar parish church on his way to the counting-hall. The Labour Party club is just across the road from the church. Harry wrote of the Labour supporters who were already celebrating victory in the morning outside the club: “It took just a moment to walk back around the church to my car but the crowd was now waiting for me. I could not refuse their invitation to a drink at the bar. They too were warm, loving and sincere. If anyone there took a picture, I want a copy. I stood with my back to the bar while my hand was pumped during Labour’s brief foretaste of victory. It was surreal but beautiful.”\\nIt was surreal but beautiful. Oh, my. Of course they loved him for one brief moment while celebrating the victory they had been told was theirs. Labour supporters understood what so many people in Sliema and Swieqi couldn’t: how the electoral system was going to work in favour of the Labour Party because of AD machinations and the absence of a correcting mechanism with more than two parties elected to the house. Harry Vassallo was Labour’s Trojan horse – an unwitting (or witless) one perhaps, and they knew it.\\nWhat can I say? In this general election, we had six party leaders, and only one of them appeared not to need a spell on the couch. The electorate chose wisely, because he’s the prime minister now.\\nAnother one who’s going to keep us guessing\\nThe only reason Sant called that press conference to say he is resigning was to pre-empt matters and prepare the way for his survival. Even he knows that the party machine is not going to tolerate him sitting tight through a fourth consecutive hammering. So he mollified them by resigning irrevocably. Soothed and reassured by this, they will not object now to his continued presence among them ‘until things are sorted out’. This despite the wisdom nagging in the sensible half of their brain that a political leader who resigns is like a managing director who resigns: he doesn’t stay on in the office pottering about and keeping an eye on things. He clears his desk, removes the family photographs, hands back the keys, the company car and his other perks, and goes home, his relationship with the company severed completely.\\nCreative means of persuasion might have to be used, like the letter making dirty accusations against Lino Spiteri, which reached the Labour Party machine just in time to put a rocket under his rival candidature in the leadership election of 1992, leaving the way open for one A. Sant.\\nUnable to fulfil his ambition himself, as he will not be allowed to stay on as leader, Sant will fulfil it through a poodle on a lead. This is unlikely to be the poodle with the ginger beard in Brussels, but it might be another sort. Part of his strategy will be to anoint that successor and ensure that the konferenza generali votes him in.\\nIt’s not as though we haven’t been there before. When Mintoff resigned, he ensured that his successor was a puppet prince. Then he stayed on in the backbenches, making his presence felt. Why do I get the feeling that the same thing is going to happen now? Sant might do it with more cunning and finesse than Mintoff did, but he is still going to do it. He has no life or role to go back to, and this type of character is unable to relinquish the aims and ambitions, the certitudes, in which his entire identity is bound up – not at this late stage in the game, anyway. Sant will survive – unless Labour closes ranks against him.\\nSo having exhausted his options as leader, Alfred Sant now intends to be a kingmaker and a power behind the throne. For those who wished to read them, he has put some of his cards on the table already. At his resignation press conference, when asked whether he would resign from his parliamentary seat and make a clean break with the party, he said that he may or may not do so when he knows who the new leader of the party is (because the new leader might wish him to stay on in a ‘consulting role’). The country is going to be treated to resignation by degree.\\nA credible resignation is one in which the party leader packs his bags and leaves, and not one in which he stays on, hanging about and meddling in affairs. And that’s why I just don’t find Alfred Sant’s resignation in the slightest bit credible. If he is managing the organisation of the general conference and monitoring the candidates, then he hasn’t really resigned at all. It was yet another mise-en-scene to throw us off the scent.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nAnglu Farrugia, still reeling under the shock of not waking up this time last week as Malta’s new justice minister, has put on his thinking cap and come up with some sparkling insight into why the Nationalists won this election. And it has nothing to do with the power of incumbency.\\nThe Nationalist Party, he told The Sunday Times, bought hundreds of votes – enough to run off with the prize of government. He said he has ‘information’ that several votes were bought in the last few days for up to €300 each. That’s the first time a Labour spokesman has used the dirty word ‘euro’, so let’s be grateful for small mercies.\\n“I’m working hard at collecting all the evidence and information at the moment,” Farrugia told the newspaper. Then he plans to take it to the paraventu. Well, he needs to keep himself amused and this will help take his mind off things, like the upcoming leadership killing-fields.\\nNow Farrugia is busy following up all the leads and clues, drawing on his considerable experience as an inspector in Lorry Pullicino’s force. He says he has been told how ‘a number of traditional Labour voters’ were paid to hand over their voting document. Pause for canned laughter.\\nMaybe the real reason he’s so cross about it is his belief that they preferred to sell their vote for a small amount of cash rather than cast it in favour of the Labour Party. Ouch, that must hurt.\\nSuper-sleuth Farrugia says he has the names of ‘individuals and clubs’ who were involved in the racket. ‘I’m convinced of this 100%,’ he told The Sunday Times.\\nYes, just like his former boss was convinced that Malta would strike oil immediately he became prime minister.\\nAnother pompous ass joins the melee\\nAs though there are not enough self-important small-town 19th-century Sicilians straight out of Il Gattopardo in this game, here’s another one to add to the general feeling of irritation.\\nFreshly elected Nationalist MP Franco Debono called The Times to point out that their reporters had made a ‘grave mistake’ in claiming that he might take Helen D’Amato’s seat. The ‘grave mistake’ was that the reporters failed to relay to their readers the important information that he had also – round of applause here – unseated Louis Galea.\\n‘This is history,’ he told The Times, and then went on to bray, ‘I didn’t say anything when you took the comments of all the other candidates and dedicated only one line to me while others got six lines. I didn’t phone you because of that. I didn’t phone you when you took Galea’s comments twice on two days and not those of the elected MPs….I have huge respect for Galea, but I think a deserve a bit of credit for the fact that I succeeded in this as well (unseating him)”.\\nWhen people said they wanted new faces in the mix, I’m sure this wasn’t what they meant.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 17th, 2008 at 5:13 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 17th, 2008 at 5:14 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nL-iljun tal-bidla gave an interview to The Sunday Times. He tried to explain why he was dumped and left to hold the fort alone at the counting-hall, and in doing so revealed cracks in Labour’s armour. ‘Somebody was needed at the headquarters,’ he said, referring to Jason Micallef and Charles Mangion as ‘they’. ‘Yesterday they issued a statement saying they were with Alfred Sant after they left the counting-hall, and I assume this is true. I kept in touch with Dr Sant. I am not the leader and I couldn’t take decisions on my own.’\\nPresumably, Sant didn’t tell him, ‘Oh by the way, Jason and Charles are here in my office. They send their best regards. Would you like to say hi?’\\n‘I have no regrets for having stayed on at the counting-hall until Tuesday,’ Michael Falzon went on. ‘I don’t want to pass judgement on anybody – but it goes without saying that all support at moments like those is more than welcome.’\\nThe interviewer, Herman Grech, asked him whether he thinks he will be tripped up when making a bid for the leadership, given that he is not part of Sant’s kitchen cabinet. ‘Nobody has the right to play dirty or to try to disrupt a fair contest,’ he replied. ‘I would be the first to declare outright that I’d be ashamed of being in a political party where the leadership election ends of fomenting even more discord and division. Jason, or anyone else for that matter, has the right to back a candidate – but no right to play dirty or to use the party’s machinery to work against somebody.’\\nIt looks like we’re not the only ones who think that Jason’s a prat.\\nMore from the Jason Micallef Fan Association\\n\\n“The MLP’s answer to the PN’s tactic of pushing forward a Sant-Gonzi confrontation was to present the MLP as a team and not as a one-man show. The problem was that whenever the MLP team appeared together on television screens they rarely smiled, as if they were endeavouring to win the National Best Glare competition. The exception was the party’s general secretary, who tended to preen and grin, and to say things that cemented a perception of total inanity.”\\nJoseph Pirotta, ‘Defeat snatched from victory’s jaws’, The Sunday Times, 16 March\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 17th, 2008 at 5:20 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nJason Micallef needs a pair of these shoes.\\nJason Micallef gave an interview to Malta Today, wearing his best baseball top. The interviewer noted that he was a little bit too casually dressed for a day in the office, but what can you expect of somebody who wears brown walking shoes with a dark suit?\\nMicallef was his usual confident self, concerned with image above all else, his own as well as the Labour Party’s. ‘I think that in 2003 the way our message was relayed was a bit outdated,’ he said. ‘The image was not that of a party which inspires you to vote for it – forget substance for a while.’\\nForget substance for a while? How about for an entire five years? No wonder Labour’s electoral programme was a rush job full of misprints and computer malfunctions, and the only thing we remember about their electoral proposals was a repeater class.\\nJason wants to be sophisticated\\nJason believes more sophistication is required. Maybe that explains the fat ties with the giant knots. Vote for Labour, because its general secretary really knows how to knot a tie – though he doesn’t have a decent pair of shoes.\\nEven a peacock knows when it’s made a mistake, but Jason Micallef just can’t get a handle on things. On Xarabank he insisted that there were 17,000 new voters in this general election. When it was pointed out to him that there were actually 34,000, he dug his heels in and kept repeating the magic number. In the Malta Today interview, he did it again. ‘There were 17,000 new voters,’ he told his interviewer, pausing only just long enough to register the fact that they didn’t seem to like his ex-boss.\\nThat really shows how on top of things he was. You’d imagine that the general secretary of a political party that hoped to win the election and form the government would know how many new voters there were, so that he could go after them with a net and a noose.\\nThat’s the problem when people are promoted beyond their abilities. They mess up. Jason Micallef is the perfect person to host Super One’s cookery show, but he isn’t the perfect person to keep the party ticking over and winning elections.\\nJason discovers the power of incumbency\\nJason tried to sound important by chucking in the phrase ‘the power of incumbency’. Now, I wonder where he first heard that? As Alfred Mifsud pointed out in one of his newspaper articles, if anybody at all was using the power of incumbency, it was Alfred Sant, taking advantage of it to consolidate his position as leader.\\nOur peacock friend had a couple of words of praise for this blog, too. He spoke to his interviewer about ‘blogs – systematic blogs that you can hardly keep up with’ –yes, you can, Jason, once you learn how to read – ‘blogs coming from government circles and contributing to the fear campaign.’ Fear campaign? How about the giggle campaign? But Jason the peacock is probably one of those people who would much rather be feared than laughed at. Now I have to work out what he means by a ‘systematic blog’.\\nSucking up\\nThere was the requisite amount of sucking up (‘I definitely do not attribute this defeat to Alfred Sant’), which also shows that he doesn’t have a clue how to read public opinion, even when it is staring him coldly in the face in the form of polls, surveys and a general election or three. Instead, he pulled out the power of incumbency again, and blamed it for the flight in to Malta of 3,400 members of the electorate who live elsewhere. The government can bring them in, because the government has the power of incumbency.\\nOh, and Jason blamed the media, too – obviously. When in doubt, slam the journalists. They’re all against us. They eat peacock for dinner.\\nThe interviewer asked the peacock in a baseball jacket whether he plans to resign. Uh-oh, wrong question. He got the stern reply that the peacock won’t resign because the statute does not oblige him to. This is like Harry Vassallo hanging on to his protected tenancy because the law does not oblige him to give it up. Micallef thought a bit of explaining might be in order: ‘I feel personally very disappointed because the country deserved a new beginning. But despite my disappointment, I still feel I have a lot to give to the party. I’m still young, and going by the support I got from the delegates out there, I feel I would be failing them if I had to leave just now.’\\nJason is the chief executive, but he’s waiting for the pope\\nHow interesting it is that Jason should think he has a lot to contribute because he’s young, rather than because he’s bright. But he had more to say. Apparently, he is now carrying the full weight of the Labour Party on his neat little shoulders. ‘Given that the leader’s resignation is irrevocable, I’m the chief executive here,’ he said. ‘What happens if I leave? You might tell me that when a pope dies, another one is elected…We have the most important election ahead of us. There would be nobody to organise it if I were to just disappear.’\\nPfffttt! There he goes, in a puff of smoke.\\nNow let’s hear what he has to say about surveys, shall we? ‘It has always been our practice not to treat surveys as the gospel truth. They are a tool which gives you an idea, perhaps a snapshot, of what the people are feeling.’ Tell that to the gamblers, Jason. No wonder they lost their rag and Labour lost three elections on the trot.\\nCue the violins\\nAnd then we had this poignant snapshot from the night when Labour’s fate was sealed. Why wasn’t Jason holding Michael Falzon’s hand at the counting-hall, the interviewer asked? He repeated the story that he was with Alfred Sant, consoling him. ‘I took Alfred Sant home in a rented car at around 1.30am, escorted by police,’ he said.\\nNow let’s see – that would be around one-and-a-half hours before Michael Falzon conceded defeat on his boss’s behalf. So was his boss snoring at home at the time? It looks like it, if our Jason is to be believed. It-tim tal-bidla, Labour United.\\nI loved the tableau of Jason and the boss in a rented car with a police escort, though, trying to go incognito by leaving the getaway Mazda behind, as they fought their way through bumper-to-bumper car-cades of delirious PN supporters waving maduma scarves. I wonder who had the foresight to rent that car? Meanwhile, as they headed home to bed, the Lion of Change battled it out at the counting-hall.\\nNow that’s what I call leadership.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 17th, 2008 at 6:41 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 17th, 2008 at 6:46 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nTuesday, 18 March (eve of public holiday)\\n2100hrs to 0400hrs\\nThe Eden Arena with the support of 89.7 BAY\\nSupporting DJs – J Joy, Miss Roberta, Ruby, Joseph Armani, Carl Bee, Luc Adams\\nFirst 1,000 tickets at €20\\nVIP tickets at €45\\nAvailable at the Eden Cinema Box Office or www.freshevents.info – [email\\xa0protected] – tel 9937 3740\\n  \\n\\n  \\nSadly, it’s not the chicken most desperate to get there first, but the kind of fancy chicken that might appeal to a fancy peacock.\\n\\nPhotograph of carnival float by Karl Consiglio\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 18th, 2008 at 9:57 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHow does Lou Bondi put up with an idiot like Toni Abela, and more to the point, why does he invite him onto the show when he has no valid contribution to make to the discussion? Perhaps it’s for comic relief. The trouble is that he’s not funny, only irritating in that Catholic-Institute-comedy-let’s-make-farting-jokes way.\\nAnna Mallia should be given more and more airtime in the current scenario because she speaks clearly and sensibly on the issue of what the Labour Party must do to get its house in order. Some of the men, like Jason Micallef (perhaps that should be ‘men’) become all hysterical, as they do when faced with a woman who talks straight and doesn’t flirt or bat her eyelashes to soften the blow of her words (tell me about it), but she’s really good value television-wise, and the perfect foil to stupid circus acts like Toni Abela.\\nGeorge Abela\\nThe interview clip with George Abela gave a very good account of the man. I tend to warm to people who have what I call ‘amused eyes’ because the light of amusement is usually the light of great intelligence. Intelligence without humour or human insight is not enough, as we have notoriously observed over the last 16 years in both the MLP and AD leadership. I also tend to look favourably on people who give measured and precise replies to questions which they grasp in a split-second. It’s another sign of a sharp and focussed mind. Give me this kind of intelligence, rather than the ‘intellectual’ sort, any day of the week.\\nGeorge Abela and Lawrence Gonzi are practically clones of each other, which is why Abela has been almost unanimously identified, outside the Labour Party at least, as the obvious leader to take the Labour Party (finally) into the modern age. The two were in the same year at university, studied together, share very similar values and remain great friends. Both of them put the missus top of the list of their priorities, which wins the respect of women who are accustomed to come third, fourth or last after work and hobbies.\\nTheir fond respect for each other is something that will make the contest between them ‘more interesting’, Abela said. It will certainly be hugely more reassuring to the rest of us to see the Labour Party with a normal, socially secure and well-balanced leader who is not hostile to any particular sector of society or business, for a change. It will also mean that 2013 will be the first campaign in recent decades in which the leaders of the political parties are neither demonised nor vilified.\\nGeorge Abela has always been pro-EU membership\\nAbela’s signal advantage is that he was and remains pro-EU, and almost certainly voted Yes in the referendum, perhaps even consolidating that vote by giving his number-one preference to the Nationalist Party in the general election that followed. Many other pro-EU Labourites did. His signal disadvantage is that he doesn’t have a seat in parliament. But as he explained to Bondi, the party leader doesn’t need to have a seat, at least not at the beginning. His primary duty would be to restructure the party from the bottom up, reform it, bring it in line with what is now required, build up morale, restore trust, and make it a party with a natural majority.\\nKarmenu Mifsud Bonnici didn’t have a parliamentary seat, either, when he was made Labour leader, and that’s why we called him Dr Zero. The MP Paul Xuereb was made to give up his seat to him, and was later rewarded with the acting presidency, though never the presidency. If George Abela is made leader, then to my mind the solution seems obvious, even though it will require a bloodbath: Alfred Sant gives up his seat to him when he begins collecting his pension in 11 months’ time. That will serve the double purpose of removing his inconvenient presence and locating a seat for the new leader.\\nBut the moment might have come and gone already\\nAh, but here’s the thing. I have this nagging feeling that George Abela’s moment has come and gone. That moment was in 1998, when Alfred Sant made such a hash of government, called an election after 22 months, and lost it. It retrospect, it now seems obvious that Sant should have been forced out at that point and replaced with the pro-EU membership and generally trusted and universally liked George Abela. That way, the 2003 general election would have been a straight contest between Abela’s pro-EU party and Fenech Adami’s pro-EU party, and there’s no guessing who would have won. Now I can’t help thinking that this particular boat has been well and truly missed.\\nTen years ago, we were all saying ‘George Abela, he’s the man.’ Ten years later on, we’re still saying it, though life and times have moved on and none of us is getting any younger – including George Abela. Yes, he is the man with the moral authority, the backbone and the sense and sensibility to bring Labour into line with contemporary thinking and behaviour. But we can’t escape the fact that this means he will be fighting his first general election as party leader at the age of 60 – the same age that Sant is now. Yes, Gonzi will be 60 too, but it won’t be his first electoral contest as party leader, and he will have nine years as prime minister under his belt.\\nShould age be a factor? Reluctantly, I must conclude that it is. We cannot underestimate Lawrence Gonzi’s supreme feat in appealing to first-time voters when he is even older than their fathers are. It is a truly amazing achievement that he managed to win their affection by taking on the role of the favourite fun uncle who is at once an authority figure but not an authority figure, who is an honorary young person who takes their side against the strict, boring and difficult parent (Sant). Gonzi will find it much harder to do this with the next crop of new voters, and Abela will find it even harder still. Also, I can’t help thinking that it is not ideal for the next general election to be a straight face-off between two men on the cusp of collecting their pension, however valid they might be. There is no doubt that one of the factors that worked against Sant in this election was the perception that he was cut off from today’s reality, and from what makes young people tick in particular. This is ironic, given that he used to his advantage his relative ‘youth’ in his first fight against Fenech Adami in 1996.\\nIdeally, the new Labour leader should be around 45, and must definitely have been pro-EU membership from day one. This is a tall order, and I can’t see the party filling it. More tragic consequences lie ahead for Labour, and for the rest of the country because of this.\\nAlfred Mifsud\\nAs the main guest on Bondiplus, Alfred Mifsud announced that he will not enter the leadership race. He said what many others believe: that Labour lost this election between 1 and 15 May 2003 – the first date being when Sant rose from the dead and threw his hat into the leadership electoral ring, and the second date being the day he was elected (surprise!). I would go even further back than that, and say that it was lost in the early and mid-1980s, years for which no apology has ever been made, even though Tony Blair has apologised for Britain’s involvement in slavery and the Pope has apologised for myriad wrong-doings committed by the Catholic Church. The still-festering wound left by those years begins to bleed again at every general election, preventing great swathes of people from even contemplating a vote for Labour. I am one of them.\\nLino Spiteri says that without Sant, Labour would have won by 7,000 votes\\nNo fan of Alfred Sant and, or so word has it, one of those who abstained in this election (not that it’s any of our business) – Lino Spiteri said on BondiPlus that Labour’s campaign was too negative and aggressive, and that this put off the middle ground. I’m so glad that somebody noticed. The silly chatterers with their inane newspaper columns were so busy remarking on how ‘negative’ the Nationalist Party’s supremely positive campaign was that they failed to focus their eyes on the other side.\\nLino Spiteri graciously said that he didn’t wish to speak too strongly about Alfred Sant now that he has gone. It’s a view that I have heard elsewhere, and with which I don’t agree. Alfred Sant may have resigned, but he is still a fact of political life, and we should be discussing his legacy and the damage he caused to the party, instead of sweeping him conveniently under the carpet. But anyway – different folks, different strokes, and Spiteri couldn’t restrain himself from saying what most of us think: that Sant played a major part in his party’s defeat. Had Sant not been leader, he said, Labour would have won by 7,000 votes. ‘Sant has several good qualities, but he didn’t have what it takes,’ Spiteri said. ‘The losing team should move aside in its entirety.’\\nThe losing team. I love that. It’s the flipside of 1996’s winning team.\\nThe working classes are having fewer children\\nThen Spiteri couldn’t restrain himself even more. Look, can you blame him? I think he was pretty circumspect, all things considered. ‘Labour must edge towards the middle class,’ he said. ‘It can’t cease to be the workers’ party, but it can’t be just a workers’ party.’ Well, of course – the demographics are against it if it stays a workers’ party. When the Labour Party was at its strongest, the working-class was the dominant demographic. Increasing affluence causes it to shrink with every passing year – and so does the fact that people from a working-class background now tend to have one or at most two children – not just for financial reasons, but also as a reaction to the crowded families they grew up in. Meanwhile, the affluent middle classes are having more children. It used to be the other way round, but no longer. Labour’s market is shrinking, while the Nationalist Party’s market continues to grow.\\nEven a bahnan would know that\\nLino Spiteri almost snapped when he spoke about Sant’s proposal for halving the surcharge no matter how high the price of oil goes. ‘You can’t promise things like that,’ he said. ‘Even a bahnan would have understood that a promise like this can’t be kept because it’s impossible.’\\nPerhaps – but there must have been plenty of bahnani at Labour’s mass meetings, because when Claudette Baldacchino quizzed them for Super One TV about what they love about Labour’s proposals, they all seemed to mention the sircarg and VAT on education (when they probably all send their children to state schools where the education is free of charge).\\nNo, Labour didn’t lose by a whisker\\nI felt like applauding Spiteri when he said what I have been trying to get through to people for the last week or so: the Labour Party did not lose by a whisker, but by a mile, and it is unfair of Labour’s present and erstwhile leaders to keep pretending that they did. In this effort they are joined by the simultaneously crowing and grieving Alternattiva Demokratika. The same sentiment is echoed by pro-Labour and pro-AD commentators. It is deceiving and misleading.\\nLabour didn’t gain any votes since 2003. It gained a relatively small percentage of the first-time vote which replaced the votes of those who died since then – but it might not even have recaptured the votes of those who were Labour supporters but who voted PN in 2003 because they favoured EU membership.\\nAs Lino Spiteri pointed out, the Nationalist Party won despite the fact that thousands of ‘PN voters’ stayed home, didn’t even collect their voting document, or went into the polling-booth and scribbled over the ‘blue’ section of the ballot-paper. ‘If all those had been persuaded to vote PN after all,’ he pointed out, ‘it would have been a tkaxkira.’ But their essential loyalty to the PN was still there, because they didn’t vote Labour or AD. In other words, they wanted Gonzi as prime minister without helping him to get there, and instead of shifting to the other parties, they simply abstained.\\nSome smart remarks from the show\\nThis blog’s top star Jason Micallef was quoted as saying that Sant couldn’t be blamed for defeat because his public performances were faultless. To which Anna Mallia replied: ‘What do you expect Jason to say? Jason is a party employee. He can’t speak against his employer.’\\nToni Abela said that ‘the media’ and journalists are biased against the Labour Party and that the Nationalist Party is well networked. To which Bondi replied; ‘Can you drop the siege mentality? There’s nothing preventing you from building your own network. And you have your own radio station, television station and newspapers, too.’ Then Anna Mallia put in: ‘Yes, we have to stop playing the victim, and accusing others of picking on us. For example, if Lou invites me here on this show, I’m not going to come along and speak against him.’ That was a botta for the fact that Toni Abela had just passed a whole series of sarcastic remarks about Lou and his support of the Nationalist Party, just as Evarist Bartolo had done on the last show prior to the general election.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 18th, 2008 at 11:29 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nJo Said is still around and looking for some reason to feel relevant, now that Labour has been beaten and AD (which he joined – what a surprise, given that it has become a dustbin for all sorts) is largely irrelevant.

I cannot remember whom I leased a plot of land to and I need to collect Euros 110,000 yearly from this tenant – what a predicament! Ahhhh, wait, someone just found a notarial deed for me…God bless him, what a relief. Ooops, there’s an outline permit at MEPA too…what a coincidence. Holy cow, I swear I did not know about all this.

Excuse me, but resign from what, exactly? The man doesn’t have a ministerial position. He is not even a parliamentary secretary or the chairman of a board. He is an MP, and the only people to who he is answerable in that parliamentary seat are the ones who put him there, i.e. those who voted for him.\\nIt is odd that AD’s politicians, who constantly hector us about the nature of democracy and our electoral system, forget the important point that MPs represent their constituents and not their political parties. If the people who voted for Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando decide that he was in the wrong, they will simply not vote for him in the next general election. Until then, they are entitled to have the person to whom they gave their number-one preference represent them in parliament, and nobody has the right to deny them this representation.\\nPullicino Orlando is answerable to the prime minister for what he did or didn’t do, in his capacity as a Nationalist politician. In his capacity as a member of parliament, he is answerable to his constituents. The nature of party politics may have obscured this fact over the years, yet it is reality. If Pullicino Orlando so decides, he can pick up his seat (not literally) and cart it across the floor, putting the Labour Party into government. There is nothing to stop him doing that except his integrity – one assumes that he has some – and his wish to remain loyal to the Nationalist Party.\\nBy saying that the prime minister should ask him to resign his seat, AD is merely demonstrating once more how little it knows about politics – even though it is the ‘political party’ which only ever had a seat in parliament when a Labour MP called Wenzu Mintoff decided one fine day in 1989 that he was an AD MP instead. Yes, he resigned from the Labour Party all right, but he kept his seat.\\nResigning from a political party does not equate with resigning one’s seat in parliament.\\nWhy don’t they check out the beam in their own eye?\\nAnd who are AD to talk, anyway? Here they are going all mealy-mouthed about Pullicino Orlando, when it’s their own leader, and not Pullicino Orlando, who is the one with a criminal conviction and facing a two-year prison sentence. It’s Harry Vassallo, not Pullicino Orlando, who is refusing to fill in 37 VAT returns on which, he has been told, any presidential waiver of his €14,000 fine is conditional. And it’s Harry Vassallo, not Pullicino Orlando, who hid from the electorate this sordid bit of business and the fact that he had put in a plea for a presidential pardon while at the same time criticising the junior transport official of doing the same when faced with a conviction for taking a bribe. Funny how nobody at whistleblower-mad AD thought of blowing the whistle on Harry. Maybe it’s because saints are always in the right.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, March 18th, 2008 at 12:14 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nJo Said posted another comment this evening, in reaction to his comments being showcased here. It just said: ‘Found a lawyer yet?’\\nPresumably, he plans to sue me for libel for posting the remarks that he wrote and sent in himself. That should be fun.\\nThen, about an hour after he sent it, another comment arrived, from somebody by the name of ‘Andre Galizia’, in fulsome and illiterate praise of Jo Said, and with a remarkably similar way of writing to that of Jo Said himself. Given that the only Andrew (Caruana) Galizia in the country is my son, I got the moderator to check out the IP address, and sure enough, it was the same as that for Jo Said’s comments. This means that both Jo Said and ‘Andre Galizia’ were using the same computer or network. Given that Jo Said famously does not work, ‘Andre Galizia’ is not somebody on the same office computer network, but somebody in Jo Said’s living-room. You’d think that somebody who imagines he is as knife-sharp as Said would have the sense to choose a false identity which did not include the surname Galizia, but what do you expect from somebody who has spent the last few months playing Musical Political Parties?\\nSo here’s the comment in praise of Jo Said, sent to us by ‘Andre Galizia’ from Jo Said’s computer, explaining to us how Said uncovered ‘loads of dearth eminating from the Pieta quarters’. That would be the hindquarters, I imagine? As for his reference to the ‘gang of coterie’ and to his belief that I am a ‘duservice to the party’, whatever that is – well, what can I say? Judging by the time of night, he must have been clearing out the drinks cupboard.\\nThis is the man on whose back Alfred Sant hoped to ride to glory.\\n“It is so abnoxious of all of you to indulge into personal insults every time one tries to expose the party you adore and make an idol of. What has the friutcake and the Gamblu shell got to do with the message Jo Said is trying to convey to you? I am usually a PN supporter, but to be perfectly honest with you I admire the guts of the man. He is the only one who uncovered loads of dearth eminating from the Pieta quarters. You do not seem to have the simple and basic nerve to stomach the truth. I am one of the many who has not cast my vote this time round. How could I if what Jo Said was relaying over the past two months proved to be the truth! How could I vote for a party that changed from a people’s party to an elite and not-so-elite gang of coterie (a word copied by Daphne from Jo Said’s writings). Ask Bondi just when and at what time of day his illegal construction was sanctioned by Mepa…..George Pullicino MUST also resign. Daphne, you are scaring away many Nationalists with your base and shameful writings. You are a duservice to the party.”\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, March 19th, 2008 at 4:00 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs the queen of mashed syntax, strange metaphors and convoluted sentences, the Labour candidate Lorna Vassallo had quite a following when she wrote a column for The Times. We would copy choice excerpts from her pieces, paste them onto emails and send them to each other for a good giggle. Pompous and self-important asses devoid of a sense of humour or self-awareness don’t have to be men.\\nFortunately, our Lorna has a website, in which she is sharing her travels with us. The site is also littered with such gems as the fact that she took ‘paid leave’ on a public holiday which fell on a Saturday, and that holiday leave is made all the more beautiful when you know that somebody else is paying for you to do nothing (a typical Labour mentality that needs to be dropped pronto).\\nSo here are some choice excerpts from the travel diaries of Labour’s own Lara Croft.\\n“We yelled loudly at every single sight uncloaked through the thick mist that made the scenery all too mysterious and the knowledge that we were but invading the reign of the anaconda.”\\n…..\\n“The cool water of the lagoon awaiting under the blue sky seemed to be an inversion of heaven and hell allowed by the gods of Canaima that made the fine dust and perspiration – proof of long travel – an asset as it stuck to our skin.

(1) (a) who is disqualified from being a Maltese parliamentarian, though he has no doubt been arguing that the Constitution does not take into account the possibility that somebody might be a citizen of Malta as well as a citizen of Italy. However, I think that the sub-article in question is clear, unequivocal and specific: “No person shall be qualified to be elected as a member of the House of Representatives if he is a citizen of a country other than Malta, having become such a citizen voluntarily, or is under a declaration of allegiance to such a country.”\\nI suppose if anybody had tried to prevent him from standing for this general election under that Constitutional provision, or even to debate the validity of his candidature, the martyrs at AD would have been out in force with their minor children and wives at a press conference, making accusations of victimisation. Two weights and two measures, as usual.\\nCassola was free to stand for the MEP elections because the Constitution has nothing to say about them. It deals only with MPs in the national parliament.\\nMugliett has the ruddy nerve to whine on\\nAll sorts of questions about Jesmond Mugliett’s position are opened up under article 55. (1) (c). It’s a shame they weren’t raised earlier in the day, rather than in the heat of an electoral campaign by an opposition political party which didn’t even have the sense to look up the Constitution and discover that by far the most effective and correct tack to take was challenging Mugliett’s tenure as an MP under this article. Instead, they chose to go with corruption, mixing up the meaning with favouritism or nepotism.\\nIt’s such a shame that Mugliett’s constituents saw fit to elect him, even if fewer than usual gave him a first preference vote. Nobody expected the prime minister to include him in his cabinet after all the trouble he caused – except for Mugliett himself, who apparently thought he was still in the running, despite everything. He had the nerve to make a fuss about it when interviewed by The Malta Independent, complaining that the prime minister sent him a text message to inform him that his services would not be required. In the prime minister’s position, I wouldn’t even have bothered with that much. I would have found it difficult to make an effort at any form of civility.\\nThis is what Mugliett – another person with no sense of self-awareness or of how he is perceived by the public – told The Malta Independent.\\n“I had always known that I was not a minister ad infinitum. It is a privilege that is granted according to the PM’s prerogative. However, I was disappointed at the way we (former cabinet members) were informed that we would not be back on board. In fact, at about 1.30pm on Wednesday I was informed via SMS that I would not be a cabinet member. I think we were owed a more dignified dismissal, as we were part of the cabinet that contributed to a PN victory.”\\nWe were part of the cabinet that contributed to a PN victory….is the man in outer space? It doesn’t take in-depth electoral analysis to work out that he was probably one of the main reasons the Nationalist Party haemorrhaged voter support over the last year or so. Not only did he lurch from one mess to another, culminating in the Regional Road bridge debacle, but his behaviour made the prime minister look weak in failing to control him and kick him out of the cabinet. Perhaps the prime minister felt he couldn’t do it then, because he didn’t have the authority of a general election to back him up. But he certainly did it now. Good for him.\\nHere’s more from Mugliett:\\n“We were at least owed an explanation as to why we were not reconsidered for a cabinet post, and a thank you.” What – does he mean that he doesn’t know why? “I have received many SMSs and e-mails from constituents saying that they wanted me in the new cabinet. They were comforted by the fact that I am tranquil and have resolved to carry on assisting them as their MP. Months before the election, I informed the PM that I had severed my ties with my professional studio and was keen to move on to new pastures; after all I am still young.”\\n“I did not expect to have such a decrease in the number of first preference votes, however, this has been a trend experienced throughout by ministers. It was symptomatic of the PN campaign calling for new blood within the cabinet. And this has been used by several candidates.”\\nYou should refer to article 55 (1) c of the Constitution of Malta, Mr Mugliett. Leaving aside the question of whether you should have resigned your ministerial post or not at the time, it seems that Sant & Mugliett’s involvement in the Regional Road bridge contract disqualified you from keeping your seat in the House. That is, unless you informed the Speaker – not the prime minister – about the situation. And if you did, then why didn’t we hear about it?\\nOnce parliament is convened, the Speaker of the House – not the prime minister, an important distinction – should immediately ascertain whether Mugliett has truly severed all connections with the partnership that is still called Sant & Mugliett. Otherwise there are going to be questions raised about the validity of his tenure as MP.\\nNobody can oblige an MP to resign, especially not the prime minister\\nBefore the recent amendments which provide for correcting mechanisms to adjust seats to votes, the Constitution of Malta made no mention of political parties, but only of members of parliament. This is because members of parliament are representatives of the people, and not of political parties. We elect them to represent us. They are answerable only to us, and to the Speaker of the House. If we dislike their performance, we will simply not vote for them next time.\\nStrictly speaking, MPs are not answerable to their party leaders, even if they are elected on a party ticket. They can be kept in line by the party whip, and they have the sense to realise that their survival depends on keeping the party leader happy, but they are free to do as they please if they so choose to do. The parliamentary seat belongs to the MP, and not to the party. He can pick it up and take it across the floor (not literally), he can vote against his party, as Mintoff did in 1998, or he can retain his seat while resigning from the party – as Wenzu Mintoff did when he resigned from the Labour Party in 1989 and kept his seat in the name of Alternattiva Demokratika.\\nI’ve realised that a lot of people don’t understand how representative democracy is rooted in MPs and not in political parties. They fail to make this crucial distinction, which is why they are now saying that the prime minister should ask Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to resign. The prime minister can do no such thing. He has no right to do so, and it would create a very dangerous precedent. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando is not answerable to the prime minister. He would be answerable to the prime minister in his capacity as a cabinet minister, were he to hold such a post. As an MP, he is answerable only to those who elected him as their representative. They are the ones who can say whether they wish him to carry on representing them or not, and the only mechanism for doing this is the next general election in 2013. Until then, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando stays whatever the merits of his case, because we cannot have a situation in which MPs are forced out of parliament by what purports to be public opinion or, even worse, autocratic pressure from the party leader. The party leader can oblige an MP to resign from the party. He cannot oblige an MP to resign his seat. That seat is his – again, I repeat, whatever the merits of the case.\\nThe Constitution does not distinguish between government and opposition MPs in disqualification and tenure\\nThis means that the article 55 (1) c which makes an MP’s seat untenable if he or she is party to a contract of service to the government of Malta – save for certain provisions – also applies to MPs on the opposition benches. They, too, are subject to scrutiny for such involvement. Here are the relevant articles from the Constitution of Malta.\\n54. Disqualification for membership of the House of Representatives\\n\\nNo person shall be qualified to be elected as a member of the House of Representatives –\\n\\nif he is a citizen of a country other than Malta having become such a citizen voluntarily or is under a declaration of allegiance to such a country;\\nsave as otherwise provided by Parliament, if he holds or is acting in any public office or is a member of the armed forces of the Government of Malta;\\nif he is a party to, or is a partner with unlimited liability in a partnership or a director or manager of a company which is a party to, a contract with the Government of Malta being a contract of works or a contract for the supply of merchandise to be used in the service of the public and has not, within one month before the date of the election, published in the Gazette a notice setting out the nature of any such contract, and his interest or the interest of any such partnership or company, therein;\\nif he is an undischarged bankrupt, having been adjudged or otherwise declared bankrupt under any law in force in Malta;\\nif he is interdicted or incapacitated for any mental infirmity or for prodigality by a court in Malta, or is otherwise determined in Malta to be of unsound mind;\\nif he is under sentence of death imposed on him by any court in Malta or is serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called), exceeding twelve months imposed on him by such a court or substituted by competent authority for some other sentence imposed on him by such a court;\\nif he holds or is acting in any office the functions of which involve any responsibility for or in connection with, the conduct of any election of members of the House of Representatives or the compilation or revision of any electoral register;\\nif he is disqualified for membership of the House of Representatives by or under any law for the time being in force in Malta by reason of his having been convicted of any offence connected with the election of members of the House of Representatives.\\n\\n\\nFor the purposes of paragraph (f) of sub-article (1) of this article –\\n\\ntwo or more sentences that are required to be served consecutively shall be regarded as separate sentences if none of them exceeds twelve months, but if any one of them exceeds that term they shall be regarded as one sentence; and\\nno account shall be taken of a sentence of imprisonment imposed as an alternative to, or in default of, the payment of a fine.\\n\\n\\nA person shall not be treated as holding, or acting in, a public office for the purpose of paragraph (b) of sub-article (1) of this article –\\n\\nif he is on leave of absence pending relinquishment of a public office;\\nif he is a teacher at the University of Malta who is not by the terms of his employment prevented from the private practice of his profession or called upon to place his whole time at the disposal of the Government of Malta.\\n\\n\\n\\n55.

We didn’t find this out through the Labour Party’s own extensive media – television, newspapers and radio – or through the good offices of Miss Miriam Dalli, head of news at Super One, but through the Nationalist Party’s media and The Times.\\nMeanwhile, the names that are being bandied about show that the Labour Party is determined to ram yet more nails into its coffin, and that it hasn’t understood why it remains unpalatable to all those thousands who usually vote PN but this time preferred to vote for no one at all rather than vote for Allahares-jitla-l-Lejber.\\nThe names are a fine mix of blasts-from-the-murky-past and complete non-starters like that twerp Joseph Muscat, who together with Jason Micallef makes a matching pair of book-ends – the one with brains, the one without, but otherwise identical. Joseph Muscat was and is Sant’s poodle, so much so that he married Sant’s personal assistant Michelle, a charming lady by all accounts but the kind who personally assisted Alfred Sant in his many trials and tribulations with The Media.\\nJoseph Muscat wrote one of those books fis-Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti which gave vent to his boss’s sick obsession with corruption under every bed and carpet. He included a whole list of Maltese people that Sant thought were associated with the government or the Nationalist Party in a many-tentacled monster that involved the Italian P2 and Mafia, the Freemasons, the Brigate Rosse and even John F. Kennedy (I couldn’t work out that one, either). Most of these people sued Muscat or the newspapers that reproduced the allegations, or came to an agreement out of court. I chose to sue both Muscat and the Labour Party, and won more than a thousand pounds off them. Muscat sent a cheque right away, because by then he was an MEP and had the spare cash. But I had to chase Jason Micallef for weeks to get my money, and only got it when I threatened to send in the bailiffs for Sant’s desk, computer and bookshelves.\\nMuscat is a protégée of Mario Vella tal-MDC – remember him? – and still regards him as his mentor. That’s why his comments about politics and the economy invariably have this Mario-Vellaesque streak about them.\\nThough Muscat is rabidly ambitious, I somehow don’t think that his rabid ambition encompasses a dull life of Maltese party politics, putting up with the slings and arrows of being an MP in this parliament or even a party leader – though he will take it up if he thinks he has a cast-iron guarantee of becoming prime minister in 2013. The boy from Burmarrad (nothing wrong there, but you get my drift) is living what he thinks is the high life in Brussels, and will probably move ahead only if he thinks there’s plenty in it for him outside the limited Maltese context. If he moves on at all, I suspect that it will be to a job in the European Commission, even though he fought so hard against EU membership, or with an international corporation.\\nOh, and he was one of those who, like his boss, decided that partnership had won the referendum. How credible is that?

In parliament, MPs do not represent their political parties, even if they are elected on a party ticket. They represent their constituents. This means the people in their electoral constituency and, more precisely, the people who actually voted for them. MPs owe their primary loyalty to their constituents and not to their party or party leader. Indeed, if something that their party does or proposes goes against the interests of their constituents, they are obliged to oppose it, whichever side of the house they happen to be sitting. Because our system of representative democracy has been diluted by party dominance, this fact is often overlooked or deemed unimportant.\\nWhatever the merits of the case, whether he is in the wrong or in the right, nobody can ask Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to resign except his constituents. The only mechanism for this is a general election. In 2013, Pullicino Orlando’s constituents will let him know whether they wish to have him carry on representing their interests in parliament or not. Until then, he is not only entitled to stay on in parliament, but he is actually obliged to do so, because he owes it to the people in not one but two constituencies who put him there. Those who imagine that it is a dereliction of duty not to resign have got things the wrong way round. It is the resignation of a parliamentary seat that is a dereliction of duty. Once people put you in parliament to represent their interests, you cannot up and say, before your term is up: “Oh stuff this. I’m going home.”\\nThe prime minister, the opposition party, Alternattiva Demokratika and what purports to be public opinion have absolutely no part to play in this and no say in the matter. It is between Pullicino Orlando and his constituents. He is a member of parliament, the representative of a group of people who voted for him to represent them. He is not a party apparatchik or factotum. Despite being elected on the party ticket, his seat is not in the gift of the party.\\nThe assertion that the prime minister should demand the resignation of an MP is ridiculous, as well as dangerous. The Constitution of Malta specifies that the resignation of an MP must be made in writing ‘under his own hand’ to the Speaker of the House – not to the party leader or the prime minister. This is because it is the Speaker, and not the party leaders, who are ‘in charge of’ – to put it like that – members of parliament. It is the Speaker who is responsible for investigating a situation which might render an MP’s seat untenable, and not the MP’s party leader.\\nThis is not a piece written in defence of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, but a piece written in defence of democracy and against the growth of dangerous ideas that threaten it. One of these dangerous ideas is that seats can be given to and taken away from MPs by political parties and ‘public opinion’ in any other way than through a general election every five years, or by bringing to bear the provisions and sub-articles spelled out in articles 54 and 55 of the Constitution of Malta.\\nThe prime minister, as leader of the Nationalist Party, can demand the resignation of Pullicino Orlando only from the party and not from parliament. Resignation from the party does not equate with resignation from parliament. If an MP resigns from his party, he will still keep his seat – just as Wenzu Mintoff did in 1989, when he resigned from the Labour Party, kept his seat, and joined AD instead, with the result that AD had a parliamentary seat for three years until the 1992 general election.\\nMPs can be kept in line by the party whip or by their understanding that if they wish to be re-elected on the party ticket, they should toe the line and keep the party happy. But it is only their own wishes and desire for survival that keep them doing this. There is nothing to stop an MP – except the voluntary factors just mentioned – from voting against his party line. Mintoff famously did this in 1998, leading to the collapse of Sant’s government.\\nAn MP’s seat is his or her own, and not the party’s. He or she can pick up that seat (not literally, of course) and take it across the floor. If it is up to our MPs to keep their party happy to ensure re-election and survival within the party, then it is also up to the parties to keep their MPs happy to ensure that they do not cross the floor, vote against the party, or find themselves forced into a corner where they use leverage or weight-pulling. Sant learned this to his cost in 1998.\\nThe resignation of an MP is not in the same category as the resignation of a cabinet minister, and quite clearly, ‘public opinion’ and the two political parties that are not in government are confusing the two separate issues. The prime minister’s office, on the other hand – you would expect Lawrence Gonzi to understand the democratic issues, the Constitution and the meaning of representative democracy – has issued a statement pointing out that the seats of MPs are matters for the electorate to decide upon, and not for the government. The prime minister can ask cabinet ministers to resign from their post of minister, because it is in his gift, but he cannot ask an MP to resign his or her seat, because that seat is not in his gift.\\nIt is fatuous of the Labour Party and Alternattiva Demokratika to decry Pullicino Orlando’s presence in parliament – which has not even been convened yet, in any case – when as political parties they should understand the meaning of representative democracy. They are fine ones to talk, in any case, given that both have rather large beams in their own eyes. The resignation demands of other sectors of society, or at least those which pretend to be coming from other sectors of society, are in the large part the result of ignorance about the Constitutional status of an MP. My instantaneous but considered reaction to these calls for Pullicino Orlando’s resignation is this: how dare these people demand that he resign, when he does not represent them and they are not the ones who elected him? The only people who have a say in the matter are the ones who will be saying what they think in 2013. Until then, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando stays, whatever he did or is deemed to have done. Who are we to pass judgement on the electoral choices of others, or to say that they have no right to be represented by Pullicino Orlando, if that is what they want?\\nThat’s what I mean about dangerous thinking. The Constitution is very clear about who may and may not be allowed to stand for election to parliament or retain a seat once there. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando falls into none of these categories. Nor do ‘honour’ or ‘integrity’ come into it. I would consider Pullicino Orlando to have integrity if he refuses to resign his seat and abdicate his responsibility to his constituents even in the face of such harsh, vicious and entirely disproportionate criticism. If he resigns his seat, he will be left in peace – but that is taking the easy way out.\\nThere is no scope for the sacrifice of token lambs here. Also, it is hypocritical of the Labour Party to use this case to obscure the fact that it has failed to police its own MPs for their shortcomings and wrong-doings. At least one notorious case that made the news in the penultimate week of the campaign involves two MPs who were ministers in Sant’s cabinet at the time, one of whom has the nerve to now put himself forward for the party leadership. As for AD and its mealy-mouthed holier-than-thou pronouncements, I think it is opportune to point out that it is the political party whose leader faces a two-year prison term for refusing to comply with the law despite years of attempts at persuading him to do so, and who had the ruddy cheek to put in a plea for a presidential pardon while criticising others for doing the same.\\nI disagree completely with the stance taken by those who say that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando could have cost the Nationalist Party the election, and that the responsibility for the loss of thousands of votes lies fairly and squarely at his door. This is tunnel-vision thinking and not lateral thinking. The allegation that Pullicino Orlando lied came far too late in the game to make significant numbers of people change their minds about voting PN. Most people missed it, and only found out after voting. Those who were going around cursing Pullicino Orlando before voting day were the ones most concerned that the Nationalist Party should win; they were cursing him because they thought he might scuttle the ship, and not because they were disillusioned with the Nationalist Party.\\n  \\n\\nJoseph Muscat tries to avoid using the chauffeur whenever possible, but sometimes you just have to keep up appearances\\n\\nWhenever the occasion allows, Joseph Muscat likes to use environmentally sound forms of transport, and gets his chauffeur to ferry him around by pedal-power.\\n\\nThe environment is the number-one item on the electorate’s agenda, and the highly intelligent Joseph Muscat knows this. Here we see him taking a photo-call a Natura 2000 site which he saved from development by a prominent member of the Nationalist Party.\\n\\nThe present prime minister of Malta is known to be very popular with young people. Joseph Muscat, with his charm and vitality, knows that he can do much better than this. Here we see him targeting the youth vote in one of his many one-to-one meetings with the first-time voters of 2013.\\n\\nJoseph Muscat increasing international fame is encapsulated in an ever-growing book of press cuttings kept by his devoted and lovely wife Michelle, former personal assistant to former prime minister Alfred Sant.\\n\\nThe youthful and glamorous future prime minister of Malta takes a much-needed vacation in Mustique as the guest of Mick Jagger, after having put the world’s problems to rights.

Here we see him following orders.\\n\\nThe future prime minister is a valiant foe in battle.

This is the most sensible piece ever to be written about AD – and it comes from the hand of somebody who is an AD councillor in Sliema. It deserves to be read and discussed, particularly by those AD activists who are currently hunkering down in their bunker and laying out the sandbags, claiming that ‘they’re all against us’, ‘the system is against us’, and ‘people don’t realise that they need us’. Let’s have your feedback.\\nAD should look ahead\\nMichael Briguglio\\nAlternattiva Demokratika’s general election is what it is, no more and no less. AD achieved a bad result in the local council elections too. No councillor was elected. Within the local council context, there is no electoral law which makes things difficult for small parties. But should AD cease to exist? I, for one, disagree. I believe that AD should look forward and do away with self-righteous bitterness and unrealistic aspirations. Move on!\\nIt is true that, as far as general elections go, the electoral system does not favour small parties. As I see it, however, it is useless whining on this. It makes much more sense to get down to business and devise political strategies based on concrete reality rather than idealistic wish lists.\\nTo begin with, an AD strategy aimed at changing the electoral system is a non-starter and will only encourage the larger parties to tilt away from such reform. If anything, this issue should be dealt with by independent civic-minded forces that aim to bring a balance between democratic representation and governability.\\nAD should do away with discourse, campaigns and initiatives that are larger than reality. It should also avoid “I-know-it-all-and-everyone-else needs-us” approaches. Instead, it should have realistic aspirations and be more down to earth. It should stop being bitter and should be honest with itself on its true size within the Maltese political context.\\nAD should aim to consolidate its results in certain previous local council and European elections. This in itself is very difficult and nothing is to be taken for granted – the current local council results are a case in point!\\nBeing an AD councillor myself (the only one who got elected twice in a row, in 2003 and 2006), I can assure everyone that this requires a lot of hard work. (In this regard, it is interesting to note the experiences of the British Green party. It does well in European and local elections – it is represented at European and local levels but, so far, has never got elected in general elections.)\\nAD should involve itself in a long political march rather than an impulsive and larger-than-life strategy. Politics is not a wish list but is deeply related to the particular political, cultural, ideological and economic realities of a particular society.\\nVoters are not brainless idiots but weigh things out before voting. And, yes, in general elections it is not surprising that 98 per cent of the electorate vote for governments and stability. A look at value surveys in Malta (which have been carried out since the 1980s and which form part of the World Value Survey) easily confirms the value priorities of Maltese people.\\nWhile continuing to give importance to environmental issues, AD should also embrace social-oriented ideology and discourse, which is in synch with the material aspirations of thousands of Maltese people. Issues such as the family, the cost of living, work and security are cases in point.\\nAD had a wrong strategy for this general election. Period. I have been saying this for a long time and I predicted such an outcome given the wrong strategy, which was not realistic, was too negative and was too cut off from various aspirations the Maltese people had. However, I did not go public as I did not wish to harm the party.\\nI would like to augur a prosperous future for AD but for this to come about there has to be a sober and realistic analysis and changes eventually made. Unrealistic expectations can only result in deep disillusionment. In sum, I believe that AD should carry out an open, sober and democratic debate within its ranks, giving a level playing field to its activists, including those who left or were sidelined.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJust look at this amusing advert for Witan Investment Trust.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 21st, 2008 at 2:39 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe know this because every time he does, one of them lets us know with a post to this blog. Here’s the latest drunken instalment, sent by Andre Galizia from Jo Said’s computer just under an hour ago.\\n“Excuse me for the silence over these last three days or so …. I was searching for a good lawyer and a superwoman to help me locate the lessee. Damn it, I have not managed yet. Hmmm would the obsessed DCG make herself available? She is mega-super in investigative stories. Or should I simply ask my notary for the missing information? My memory is not that good lately. She locates a network, so she can use her probing powers to pinpoint where the lessee is. Jo Said gives me the impression he let Gonzi in on this one, way back in December last year.”\\n“BTW that DGC creature really likes spinning. Read my lips dude (or should it be duda?): Galizia (Galicia) is in Spain where there is lots of bull!”\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe widespread confusion about whether Pullicino Orlando should or shouldn’t resign, whether he may be obliged to do so and by whom or what, only points to the absolute dearth of civic education in our schools and university. While the so-called man-in-the-street can be forgiven for not knowing certain things or not grasping certain concepts, it is unforgivable that people who have been part and parcel of political life should manifest such a gross misunderstanding of basic democratic tenets, a poor handle on the separation of powers, and near-complete ignorance of the constitutional role of a member of parliament, except in the narrowest legal sense. Above and beyond my column last Thursday, here are some further points that need to be made.\\nIf the Nationalist Party is so upset with the behaviour of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, then the Nationalist Party has a choice of only two roads open to it: to demand his resignation from the party, or to kick him out. The Nationalist Party cannot demand that he resign his seat as an MP, because seats in parliament are not in the gift of political parties and the Constitution protects individual MPs from any such depredations. In fact, the Constitution does not even consider the existence of political parties, except when discussing the mechanisms that come into play when a party gains a minority of votes and a majority of seats. As far as the Constitution is concerned, there is no such thing as a Nationalist MP or a Labour MP. There are only MPs.\\nThe reason that some elements within the Nationalist Party are working behind the scenes for Pullicino Orlando’s resignation from parliament rather than from the party – even though the Nationalist Party is entitled only to demand the latter – is obvious. They want to rid themselves of Pullicino Orlando while keeping his seat for the party and maintaining its majority in parliament, and hence, the government. They do not want Pullicino Orlando to resign from the party. In fact, they are probably delirious with fear that he might, in which case I must ask why they are going out of their way to claim their pound of flesh and back him up against the wall. If he resigns from the party he automatically becomes an independent MP. Resignation from the party does not equate with resignation from parliament. MPs who resign from the party keep their seats, because their seats are not dependent on the party, despite their being elected on the party ticket. The Constitution doesn’t give a flying monkey’s about political parties, except where spelling out the mechanism for the adjustment of seats.\\nSo if Pullicino Orlando resigns from the party, which is what the party should ask him to do if it is so deeply upset, the Nationalist Party and the Labour Party will have equal numbers of seats, with Pullicino Orlando in the middle playing the role that Harry Vassallo and Arnold Cassola so coveted.\\nThat is one reason why I cannot, for the life of me, understand why some elements in the Nationalist Party are insisting on escalating the matter and attempting to create public hysteria about this case, aided and abetted by the Labour Party and AD. Nor can I understand why newspaper columnists and other commentators who should know better are insisting that Pullicino Orlando ‘should do the right thing and go’, when he does not represent their interests in parliament, nor is he their MP.\\n\\nAll efforts by some elements within the Nationalist Party to force Pullicino Orlando to vacate his seat drive right against our particular form of representative democracy, which is rooted in individual MPs and not in political parties, as spelled out in our Constitution. That seat does not belong to the Nationalist Party. It belongs to Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando.I have to repeat that in our system of representative democracy, MPs are answerable only to their constituents – or more precisely, to those who elect them. Absolutely nobody has the right to remove, or to work for the removal of, an MP except those who voted for him. This happens at a general election, when they might decide not to vote for him again. Absolutely no one else has the right to interfere: not the prime minister, not the Nationalist Party, not the Labour Party, not the constituents of other districts, and certainly not Alternattiva Demokratika, newspaper columnists, opinion pollsters, or whatever is currently masquerading as public opinion. Our Constitution protects MPs against precisely this kind of baying of the mob, and rightly so. It’s called democracy, as opposed to Stalinism.\\nThe idea that an MP can be forced or ‘persuaded’ to resign because he has done something that sectors of society other than his constituents do not like or object to is so profoundly undemocratic – so appalling – that I regard it with horror. If we start down that road, where will it all end?\\n\\nI find it hard to believe that the prime minister is behind all this. As a pragmatist with a very sharp mind, he will have a firm grasp on the dangerous ramifications of this course of action. His office has already issued a statement pointing out that the seats of members of parliament are a matter on which the electorate decides. But quite apart from the democratic aspects, he will also know that embarking on such a high-risk strategy – trying to force an MP to resign by bringing out the baying mob and fanning the flames of ‘public anger’ – is extremely irresponsible. The odds are that both the government and the Nationalist Party will end up hoist by their own petard.The Nationalist Party needs Pullicino Orlando’s seat. And because Pullicino Orlando’s seat comes with Pullicino Orlando attached to it, it follows that they need him too. The current attempt at trying to keep Pullicino Orlando’s seat without Pullicino Orlando in it is a democratic non-starter. From a practical point of view, it is stupidly dangerous in terms of strategy. It would have been insane even for the Nationalist Party to permit the escalation of this matter without applying damage management. To watch the Nationalist Party escalating the issue itself, and deliberately so, leaves me bug-eyed in consternation.\\nThe prime minister should demand, forcefully, that his underlings and minions stop this nonsense at once. In the interest of all that is commonsense and democracy, the Pullicino Orlando case should be investigated, calmly and without political pressure, by the police. Then if it reaches that stage, it should be decided upon, also calmly and without political pressure, by the courts. Do people understand what the separation of powers means, and what it is there for? I am beginning to doubt it.\\n\\nThe prime minister is not the sort to stamp his little feet because he has Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando on his side of the House and doesn’t want him there. He is the sort to deal with it. Over the course of the election campaign, he dealt smilingly with the fractious behaviour of a thousand whiners and whingers threatening him with their vote. I am pretty sure he can cope with this situation. Otherwise, what he is doing (if he is doing it, which I doubt) is exactly what Sant did in the PBS studios: calling for the removal by unorthodox means of the upsetting presence of a fellow MP.In situations like this, we must ask ourselves: who gains? (Please don’t all write in at once with the Latin maxim.) The answer to this question is simple: those who have most to gain by the removal of Pullicino Orlando are the Nationalist candidates, on his districts, who were not elected. In the district where I vote, these include two candidates whom I made a point of not voting for: Michael Asciak of Opus Dei and Tony Abela tar-Rabat. I would be very cross indeed if the MP for whom I did vote were forced to resign only to be replaced by somebody for whom I specifically did not vote, and for valid reasons.\\nIf the constituents of the district where I live voted for Pullicino Orlando, and not for X or Y, then our wishes have to be respected, including by Pullicino Orlando. He would not be justified in resigning because he has no way of knowing whether those who put him in that seat to represent them wish him to go away and be replaced by somebody for whom they did not vote.\\n\\nIt is a serious business indeed when a political party brings its machine to bear, whipping up public opinion, against an MP it wishes to rid itself of while keeping his seat. It is the kind of thing one might have expected of Dom Mintoff. It is only if Pullicino Orlando is convicted by the courts of a crime that carries a sentence of more than one year in prison that we can speak of removing him from parliament – and then it is in the hands of the Speaker of the House, and not of the prime minister.I was informed in terse terms that “lying to the prime minister” is a resignation matter. Yes, of course it is, I replied – and that’s exactly why the prime minister should ask Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to resign from the Nationalist Party if he understands that he has been lied to. On the other hand, nobody is obliged to resign their seat in parliament because they “lied to the prime minister”, and no prime minister has the right to expect or request their resignation. Pullicino Orlando’s constituents, for the sake of argument, might be indifferent to his behaviour; they might excuse it, forgive it, or even like it, for all we know. There is no accounting for taste. After all, several thousand people voted for Jesmond Mugliett and for Franco Debono.\\nThere was a frozen silence, as expected, given that the people who are arguing like this don’t like having it pointed out to them that a party leader who feels abused by a party member can only ask for that party member’s resignation from the party, and not from parliament.\\n\\nThere’s something else, too, which is confusing people. When the prime minister and the leader of the opposition asked the police commissioner to investigate this case, they did so as ordinary citizens. It was no different to my going up to the police commissioner and asking for an investigation. Neither the prime minister nor the leader of the opposition has a specific, still less superior, role to play in asking for investigations into alleged cases of corruption. They are taken more seriously by the Police Commissioner, perhaps, but that is entirely up to his own discretion. They are certainly not taken more seriously by the law.This particular fiction was created by the behaviour of Lawrence Gonzi and Alfred Sant in the last week of the election campaign. Both of them – perhaps unintentionally – created the impression that they were demanding an investigation in their respective roles as prime minister and opposition leader. Alfred Sant went one further by dragging the press along and creating a circus.\\nNow that the matter is with the police, it is out of the prime minister’s hands. What am I saying? It has always been out of the prime minister’s hands, because we do not live in a country where the prime minister can cross the boundaries that separate the powers. We did so once, yes, but that was in the 1970s and the early to mid-1980s. If the case reaches the courts, and the courts take a decision which makes Pullicino Orlando’s seat untenable in terms of article 55 of the Constitution of Malta, it is the Speaker of the House, and not the prime minister, who must then act to have him removed.\\nI cannot repeat often enough that the prime minister has no role at all to play in a situation like this. Nor should he have such a role, as we cannot have a situation in which MPs – who represent those who voted for them and not the political parties – are forced out by party leaders who don’t like them. If a prime minister wants to rid himself of an MP when he has a one-seat majority in parliament, his only choice is to do what Sant did in 1998, and call a snap election. Sant tried to rid himself of Mintoff, and instead the country rid itself of Sant. A prime minister is referred to as the primus inter pares – or first among equals – for the simple reason that, in parliamentary terms and in terms of our Constitution, this is precisely what he is. In parliament, he has no Constitutional status greater than that of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Both are MPs.\\nBy trying to force the resignation of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, the Nationalist Party is making itself a hostage to fortune. Does it seriously imagine that over the course of the next five years, not one of its other 33 MPs (I leave the prime minister out of this because I consider him to be beyond reproach) will give cause for concern or even for scandal? Unless it is going to operate a system of two weights and two measures, it will then have to try forcing those other trouble-makers to resign, too. That should be fun – five whole years of musical chairs.\\nBut we have a system of two weights and two measures already. Jesmond Mugliett, despite giving repeated cause for scandal through his various ministerial responsibilities and almost certainly being responsible for much of the voter haemorrhage suffered by the Nationalist Party in the last couple of years, was not even made to resign from his cabinet post. Now a demand for the resignation of a cabinet minister is an entirely different kettle of fish, because a minister is part of the executive. For all the reasons I have outlined here, asking Mugliett to resign his parliamentary seat didn’t even cross the remoter regions of the government’s mind. But he should have certainly been made to resign as minister, and the prime minister paid the price at the polls for not doing so. Why? Because people understood that he could have removed him and didn’t – unlike with Pullicino Orlando and his seat in parliament.\\nIt was the same with John Dalli, who has now been returned to the fold. When there were accusations against him, he was asked to resign his cabinet position. Nobody said anything about resigning his parliamentary seat – again, for all the reasons I have outlined here. Pullicino Orlando doesn’t have a ministerial post to resign. Not being given one, and having the baying hounds put on his heels, is apparently not enough punishment – so they are going after his seat as well.\\nThis is exactly the kind of anti-democratic thinking and behaviour I fought the Labour Party about. I am not going to tolerate for one minute any attempt at the forced removal of my MP without having my approval sought and obtained. The next opportunity for that is at the polls in 2013. I have my own views about his behaviour, but I object on principle to being told that I cannot be represented by the person I chose to represent me. I object most strenuously to having this decision made over my head and in blatant defiance of my wishes as expressed at the polls. Whether Pullicino Orlando stays or goes is something that we decide, his constituents, and not something that is decided for us by others, none of whose business it is. How dare anyone suggest otherwise?\\n\\nIn this general election, the Nationalist Party included in its candidate list several individuals with a large neon sign above their heads that said ‘Trouble’. Some of them have a history of shady deals. Others are on the make. A couple define wrong and right as what is wrong and right for them. One of them had just been thrown out of the house by his wife, who has a young baby, because she had caught him having a sexual relationship with a prominent woman whose brother is a Labour MP – not that the identity of the brother was a factor in his being thrown out of the house, but it does make things even messier, politically speaking. This same candidate has some question marks hanging over his head when it comes to – how shall it put it? – straight dealing. I was very cross at his inclusion in the list because I believe that electors should know what they are voting for, and if this man was being put forward by Lawrence Gonzi and the family values party, people who weren’t in the know would assume that he was OK, rather than the kind of man who cheats on his wife while she’s having a baby.So according to the Nationalist Party’s scale of values, it is all right for a man to lie to his wife but lying to the party boss is a beheading offence. Well, I’m sorry, but I beg to differ. Give me the man who lies to the boss any day over the man who cheats on his wife while she’s having a baby. And I’m sure that every woman in this country will say the same, and some men too. Fortunately, the candidate in question was not elected. But if he were elected, we would have observed the delicious irony of this confirmed liar and cheat being allowed to watch from the comfort of his parliamentary seat the hounding of another MP who had the audacity to “lie to the boss”.\\nThe Nationalist Party should vet its candidates before the general election. Afterwards, if those candidates are elected, there is nothing that can be done: tough, but true.\\n\\nNowhere in this case has there been any suggestion that Pullicino Orlando paid to get what he wanted. That’s corruption. Hitting the telephones to talk to people is not corruption. It is undue influence, and there are no legal sanctions against it – only disciplinary procedures, and only against the civil servants or public officers who give into it. When I hear the pseudo-scandalised tones of those on board the x’ gharukaza train (“he phoned people!”), I want to give up, get out of this well with its tunnel-vision people, and take a nice, long sabbatical in Manhattan.If we are going to start criminally investigating MPs and forcing them to resign for lobbying government departments and public service authorities, we had better get the other 66 MPs in line and start now. Again, I leave out Gonzi and I even leave out Sant. MPs lobby for their constituents all the time. It’s their job. It’s what they’re paid to do, in case we forget this. They cross the line when they bring undue influence to bear, or when they lobby for themselves. Pullicino Orlando wasn’t the only one to have been (allegedly) doing this. He was the only one to get caught. And let’s be honest, the only reason he is being made to pay such a high price, and in public too, is because he snagged the progress of the campaign in the last week, and has been blamed for the loss of votes (while the votes he pulled in with that stunt in the PBS studios were, of course, not acknowledged).\\nI really can’t stand any mealy-mouthed hypocrisy of this nature. Our parliament is jam-packed with seedy characters on both sides of the House – people who are already trouble or who have great potential for creating trouble over the next five years. Let’s get some sense of perspective on this one. And let’s remember that we are living in a democratic country with a clear delineation between the powers and a Constitution that safeguards MPs against the depredations of their political masters or ‘public opinion.’\\nAnd let us above all remember that ‘public opinion’ is often little more than the baying of the mob. Decisions taken in haste and panic to please that baying mob and to protect the ruler from its anger translate into the commission of grave injustices – most infamously on that day in Biblical history that led to the feast we are commemorating today, which began with the mob’s cry to crucify a scapegoat, and a decision taken to appease the mob in defiance of the law.\\nAnd lest anyone rush forwards to claim otherwise, I would have written exactly the same way if the case involved an MP for whom I did not vote, including opposition MPs. There are some very important principles at stake here, and those who do not recognise this would have been more at home in the days when the ruler shouted ‘Off with his head’ and the underlings rushed to do his bidding.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJeffrey Pullicino Orlando has just issued this statement to the media, in response to George Micallef’s statement.\\nStatement by Dr. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando.\\nI have read in detail the Statement issued today by Mr. George Micallef.\\nI am unaware of what prompted Mr. Micallef to issue such a Statement at this particular time whilst Police investigations are still under way.\\nIn view of such investigations, as Mr. Micallef may be well aware, I am unable to fully reply in detail about the incorrect, misleading and untrue comments made by him in my regard, and brought to the attention of the public at this stage – which stage has been described by the media as the final stage of the investigations in which the Police authorities are expected to refer the matter to the Attorney General.

Whilst I was aware at the time that this was being deemed as a limited-scale development, I have now confirmed that this had in fact been planned to accommodate a total of about four hundred patrons (as opposed to the four to eight thousand indicated by the then Leader of the Opposition and the Malta Labour Party media)\\nAs previously publicly stated, beyond this I was not aware of the details of the project and, in fact, the first time I saw the plans and details of the full development application submitted was when I was shown these at the Police Headquarters. I also do not know nor had I ever met the actual applicant – who was not the same person with whom I had signed the rent agreement.\\nI confirm what I have consistently stated to journalists who have contacted me in these days in which I am being subjected to intense media pressure in order to give full details of my involvement in this case, namely that:-\\nI have fully cooperated with the investigating officers, replied to all their questions and have given them a full detailed statement; and\\nI am more than fully prepared to make a public statement of my entire involvement in this matter and to answer to the questions that have been put to me, as soon as the investigation and its outcome are concluded.\\nAt that point I shall be able to freely state all details of this case as are known to me. In doing so I shall definitely not wilfully seek to explain or justify my actions by pointing fingers at others.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe Labour Party has given, as one of the reasons why it can’t take up George Abela’s suggestion to have the new leader elected by party members and not just party delegates, the fact that lots of people are members of both the Nationalist Party and the Labour Party. What sort of people might these be?\\nWe can’t just rush to the conclusion that they are all kuntratturi or tal-bizniz who want to keep their options open and suck up to both sides. That kind usually sorts things out by donating money. And before lots of people post comments about the ugliness of such donations, let’s just say that it’s the system used in lots of highly civilised places. Political parties ‘need to eat’ as well, and they can’t make the money they need for their hobza ta’ kuljum through entrepreneurial activities, though they do try. Also, I’m sure most of you would rather they got the money this way than through your taxes.\\nA report in The Times the other day quoted ‘party insiders’ as saying that the numbers of such fence-sitters “could even run into hundreds”. Obviously, Labour is unwilling to let these hundreds of members of the Nationalist Party use their Labour Party membership to choose the new leader – though why Labour is so against it isn’t immediately clear. It might actually be a good idea to let them have a go. The Nationalist Party is pretty adept at selecting leaders.\\n“These people would have to be weeded out, and that takes a lot of time,” the party source told the newspaper.\\nThat’s interesting – I suppose lots of people like to keep lots of other people guessing.\\nIt’s no wonder that Jason Micallef rarely seems to know what’s going on.\\nTony tar-Rabat’s fans aren’t pleased with me\\nCui prodest scelus, is fecit.\\n– Seneca, Medea\\n(The murderer is the one who gains by the murder.)\\nIn my column last Sunday, I wrote that when we look at the repeated calls for Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s resignation (when no such calls were made for the resignation of Karmenu Vella and Charles Mangion, both of whom were shown to have been cheating on income tax while they were cabinet ministers, and not just mere MPs), we must ask: who gains (by the resignation)?\\nI asked my readers not to rush at me all at once with the Latin expression that I couldn’t remember while writing, but I’ve since found it. Cui bono? Cicero quoted it as a maxim of Cassius. Seneca gave us a more elaborate version in Medea.\\nYesterday, I wrote that I made a point of not voting for Tony Abela tar-Rabat, for valid reasons, nor for Michael Asciak of Opus Dei, also for valid reasons. Yet the former is one of those next in line for JPO’s seat on our district should he resign. True, even if JPO doesn’t resign he will have to give up one of his two seats and our district may be the one – so I could still end up with Tony tar-Rabat as my MP.\\nAh, well, never mind – what I find interesting is that today this rather odd letter appeared in one of the newspapers for which I write, The Malta Independent.\\n\\nIt made me yawn\\nI refer to Daphne’ Caruana Galizia’s contribution (TMID, 20 March), to urge her never again to defend the indefensible.\\nHow boring her article was on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. It was obviously written by a legal hand, and she penned her name to it. I feel let down. Ms Daphne obviously does not have much of a mind of her own. She should stop trying to interpret the law. It made me yawn. To say that only JPO’s constituents have a say! What utter rot. Who fed her that line? JPO was elected on false pretences. He had the Prime Minister’s smile, and that got the dentist elected on two districts. Now the Prime Minister wants nothing to do with the tooth puller because he was deceived. Though he did not let on about that deception until after the election. How insincere Of JPO, Ms Daphne and Dr Gonzi.\\nReally, the article read as boring as the picture accompanying it. She should change that too. What is she trying to tell us? That she is some saint? We know she is not. Does she?\\nC. Galea\\nRabat\\nLet’s leave aside the libellous (and ridiculous) assertion that ‘it was obviously written by a legal hand, and she penned her name to it.’ Apparently, I can write about any matter under the sun, including astrophysics, but law is best left to the lawyers ghax ma nifhimx. Mela hija – ghalhekk gab id-dikri Anglu Farrugia, hej.\\nIf this person had been from anywhere other than Rabat, my antennae wouldn’t have begun to twitch. That, the personal invective and the line ‘he had the prime minister’s smile’ (sub-literate, but you still get the meaning) tell me that a rather large axe is being ground here.\\nAnd the last line tells me that the person who wrote the letter didn’t actually read the article, because s/he would have noticed that ‘the picture as boring as the article’ was changed a couple of weeks ago. I was quite bored of it, too.\\nAre Abela’s fans now blaming third parties for his failure to be elected? I think his constituents sorted that one out, good and proper.\\nThe most cringe-worthy aspect of the prime minister’s visits to Rabat and Mosta during the election campaign was not the sight of those housewives jumping about and crooning with the Super One TV microphone, but Abela’s face trying to cram into the shot over the prime minister’s shoulder. Oh God, I thought, as I mentally counted the votes trickling out of the door. Looks like I was right, and he wasn’t exactly the most popular boy at the party.\\nOh well, never mind – if JPO is knocked out of the door and we get Tony Abela instead, I’m sure there’ll be a whole queue of people from Rabat lining up to tell me why he’s more honest, straightforward and decent and more worthy of that ruddy Godforsaken seat.\\nHaving been rejected by Malta, Arnold is Italian again\\nThat Arnold Cassola is utterly shameless. No wonder he got so few votes in this last election, and then AD blamed ‘the system’.\\nHe flew in to Malta to tell us that coalition works, in the fond hope of securing a deal-making seat for himself in parliament, only to be shown the door. Now he has reverted to plan A. Those of you who thought that a seat in the Maltese parliament was plan A for Cassola don’t know the Italian parliamentary pay and pensions scale. Now Cassola is in la bella Italia, soliciting for votes – though thankfully not on street corners.\\nHe has come up with a cunning plan to fill a gap in the already crowded Italian political market: going after the votes of Italian expatriates in the election of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, which is next month. Make haste, Arnold – not much time left!\\nI owe to Fausto Majistral of malta9thermidor.blogspot.com this translation of how Cassola is canvassing for votes. Here it is:\\n“As a direct representative in the Chamber of Deputies of Italians abroad, I too have lived a good part of my life abroad. Because of this I feel I’m very close to your reality. I have lived in the first person many of the problems which we face and I have come to know of others through my continuous contacts with Italians in Europe.”\\nTell me something, are party politics particularly attractive to this kind of person best described by a rude word beginning with w and ending in r? I look about me, and there are heaps of them. In this last general election, you could count the straightforward types on your fingers and not have to resort to your toes. And as for the party leaders….\\nFausto thinks that Cassola will be flying back in to Malta next year trying to convince us to make him an MEP. He got 23,000 votes last time round, as AD keeps reminding us, uselessly. There’s another good word to describe this kind of person. It begins with o and ends with t.\\nEeeeehhhhh, Anglu tal-Gift of Life, ta!\\nOk, folks – now here’s a hard one. What does Anglu Farrugia have in common with Tonio Borg, apart from the fact that they are both lawyers (of markedly different quality) and one was minister for justice while the other was desperate to be that?\\nEach is his political party’s champion of the Gift of Life Movement and its drive to have an article about abortion slotted into the Constitution, when it is already catered for by the Criminal Code.\\nL-aqwa li Anglu favur il-feti u l-giti mal-iljunfanti (u l-ispirtu ta’ Lady Di).\\nPaul Vincenti and Gift of Life are lying low for a little while, but once the new government is nicely settled in and parliament is convened, they’re going to begin hammering away again, wearing down the last of the remaining politicians’ resistance to their mighty cause. Let’s see if they have better luck with the new Labour leader. If it’s Anglu Bellu, they’re in clover.\\nFortunately, Tonio Borg is no longer Justice Minister, and as Foreign Minister, I can’t see him writing to ambassadors to support Gift of Life’s cause. A couple of years ago, he wrote to every single organisation in this country to support that same cause when he was Justice Minister, including the Malta Floral Club and the Jiu Jitsu Association, or variations on those themes.\\nAnd that, strangely enough, was not considered the bringing to bear of undue influence. Nobody called for his resignation. Oh no – of course not. There was no business involved, no money being made, only pressure brought to bear on associations and organisations to support the minister’s personal religious cause – something I find much more offensive, and with potentially graver consequences, than any disco in Mistra.\\nI don’t like the idea of a disco in Mistra, just in case you were wondering (and that’s mainly because I’m long past the age when I thought nightclubs were interesting). But I’ll tell you this: I like the idea of fiddling around with abortion and the Constitution far, far less. Obviously, I am in a minority on this one, because the majority of Maltese Catholics can’t distinguish between the rightness of practising their religion and the wrongness of imposing its rules on others who don’t. But there you have it.\\nThe anthropologist Paul Sant Cassia put it well in a comment on The Times on-line, though he was arguing in a very different context. The British and Americans consider sex to be a resignation offence; the Maltese don’t mind sex but they sure as hell mind the thought that others might be making some money (my paraphrasing of his words).\\n  \\n\\n  \\nNot that I wish to sound smug or anything, lest I be mistaken for Joseph Muscat – but it’s nice to know that Alfred Sant is still as easy as ever to read and to predict (for me at least). The trick is always to take his words literally, and not to attribute to them the wider and unspoken meaning that might be implied by others who speak the same words. Hence: removing VAT meant exactly that. It did not also mean not putting another tax in its place, which is what you and I might understand. And so on.\\nSo when Sant said he was resigning irrevocably, that is exactly what he meant. He did not also mean that he would be packing his bags, severing his links with the Labour administration, and going home to feed his chickens and read or write books. He said he was resigning irrevocably, and some people made the mistake of reading into it the wider meaning that the press conference was his swansong. There are people now who are saying that we should leave him alone because he has gone. Ah, but he hasn’t gone, and we are about to have this demonstrated to us in a really big way.\\nThis is what I posted on Friday, 14 March: “I can’t imagine how people believe that because Alfred Sant said he is resigning ‘irrevocably’ that we have seen the back of him. He hasn’t ridden off into the sun-set. He hasn’t taken a world cruise. He’s still there. And that’s exactly where he’s going to stay – an albatross around Labour’s neck. He is not interested in the best interest of the party. He is not interested in reform. He is interested only in achieving what he set out to achieve 40 years ago. The particular psychology of the man does not allow him to let go of an idea, an aim or an ambition. He is obsessive. Observing him over the last 16 years, we should have picked up that much. He was prepared to sacrifice the interests of his political party to fulfill his personal desires. He was prepared to sit tight through three losses in two general elections and one referendum. So why is it now being assumed that he has had a snap personality change at the age of 60 and learned how to move on?…..So having exhausted his options as leader, Alfred Sant now intends to be a kingmaker and a power behind the throne. I don’t hesitate in telling you this: just mark my words.”\\nOh. My. God. The new Labour leader is Sant’s poodle\\nThis is the bit that I got wrong. I thought that it was unlikely that Sant would pick the poodle with the ginger beard in Brussels, because he would never get away with making a 34-year-old the party boss-man. I thought it more likely to be his long-time best mate Evarist Bartolo, with the poodle chiming in as deputy.\\nBut the way that Joseph Muscat is speaking as though his party leadership is a fait accompli tells me that it is going to be the other way round: Joseph Muscat as party leader with Bartolo as one of the bridesmaids.\\nSo mark my words again – Joseph Muscat is the anointed one, and as the anointed one, he is almost certainly going to be the new Labour leader.\\nMuscat wouldn’t be taking it for granted that the leadership election is as good as won for him unless it is because the Irrevocably Resigned Boss is going to drive it through. This means that Sant has him on a leash and will be ruling the party by proxy. If Muscat doesn’t manage to shake him off in the next five years, or is unwilling to do so (after all, he thinks the sun shines out of his rear end), then the shadow of Sant is going to continue to haunt the Labour Party, and the country, right through up to the next general election and beyond.\\nAt some point, a Labour MP is going to have to give up his seat in parliament so that Muscat can be co-opted as Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, Mintoff’s anointed one, was. It will be interesting to see whether that person is going to be Sant, or whether some hapless person will be made to pay the price.\\nAnother prat: it’s Jason but with some brains\\nThere’s something about the Labour Party that makes it a magnet for arrogant prats, though I would dearly love to use instead another word that also begins with ‘pr’. I’m also going to use another bad word, but with asterisks as this is a family blog, when I ask: is Labour really so partial to w****rs?\\nJoseph Muscat is just Jason with (some) brains: a rather shallow chap who cosied up to the lonely and insecure boss, won his confidence, gave him his undying loyalty, did everything he asked, and became the anointed one. Despite his brains, he remains as inane, vain, preening and self-satisfied as Jason Micallef, and those who can’t see this need some really thick glasses. I can’t understand those who are seeing Muscat as the JFK for Labour’s new millennium, a decade of which has gone by already. Can’t they see that the only reason he looks like a good option is because the rest are rubbish, except for George Abela? Given a choice between Joseph Muscat and Anglu Farrugia, even I would choose Joseph Muscat. But the Labour Party is clearly not being allowed to think outside the box and consider other options here, because this man has been anointed and so the party is lumped with him.\\nNever trust a man with a goatee, they say – which doesn’t say much for Clyde Puli – and they’re right, whoever they are. There is something a bit peculiar about men who carefully shave that little shape around their mouths every morning, like paedos and pervy professors from central casting. The first thing that this man must do is stick to the maxim: a beard must reach your ears; otherwise shave off the lot.\\nSo how do I know he’s going to be the new leader?\\nWell, the first clue was when that brain-box Jason, who doesn’t know the wisdom of playing his cards close to his chest, brushed off George Abela on Xarabank. Something about the way he did that told me that Abela wasn’t even in the running, and that the leader was a foregone conclusion and Jason was feeling superior and in the know. Of course, I will ring the Gloria if Abela is elected against almost insurmountable odds, but I get this feeling that he’s dead in the water.\\nThe second clue was that Muscat was the first to leave that nighttime meeting at Labour HQ when a decision was taken about the leadership election. The paparazzi were outside, taking note of who was entering and who was leaving, and Muscat was the first to leave, fairly early at around 2130hrs, though the laqgha dragged on way past midnight. What did that tell me? That he was confident enough not to hang around until the last person had left, to avoid the chance of being done in during his absence. He was so confident that he popped off home and left them all to it.\\nThe third clue – more like a whacking great conclusion, really – was Herman Grech’s interview with Muscat two days ago in The Sunday Times. Now that told me all I need to know. He’s already talking of himself as the Labour Party leader, and has a 15-year strategy mapped out (that was quick).\\nHe scores points off Jason for arrogant antipatija\\nThere are some young(ish) men who are the male equivalent of those horrid ‘girls’ who were raised by daddy to be little princesses, and who go through adult life expecting to charm everyone and setting their teeth on edge instead. These are the ‘boys’ who were their mothers’ pets, either because they were good-looking, or charming, or clever, or all three, and who go through life with no sense of self-awareness, on an endless parade of ‘arani, ma!’ As adults, they come across as smug and conceited, vain and preening, self-absorbed and full of self-admiration. They are the sort who turn on the charm offensive and who are flabbergasted when it fails to work – hence Jason Micallef flashing his smile in highly inappropriate situations.\\nAnd hence Joseph Muscat, talking like it-tifel bravu tal-mama in his interview with The Sunday Times. If he is really going to be Malta’s next prime minister, he had better grow up fast.\\nHere are some choice excerpts.\\n“People see me as a person they can work with. I have a 15-year project for the party and the country. During a maximum five years in opposition, we will spend the first two years transforming the party…In the third and fourth years, we will tell people what we want to do. Experience has shown us that telling the electorate that the Nationalists have lied and are not delivering is not enough. People want to know what we are doing.”\\nDing-dong! The bell has finally gone off. And a 15-year project for the party and the country, eh? Then there are those who insist that he and his boss haven’t hatched this little plot between them. I suppose Muscat wrote his 15-year plan in the 10 days between Sant’s irrevocable resignation and his interview.\\n“The Labour Party has to map out a clear manifesto by the next election, so that the electorate knows where it stands on all issues.”\\nDing-dong again! Kemm hu bravu l-boy. Skopra l-Amerka. Yes, Joseph – and this time, make sure that it has no misprints, no computer malfunctions, and no items that have already been done by the government. You’ve got five years for writing and proof-reading. Start now.\\nBad sign: he speaks of himself in the third person\\n“I will say it loud and clear – Joseph Muscat as leader of the Labour Party is an invitation for everybody to work together. Choosing Joseph does not mean excluding Michael or George. I want to be everyone’s leader, not a leader of a faction. I don’t want to spend the next five years watching my back but looking forward, convincing people that they can trust the Labour Party to govern this country.”\\nSee? What did I tell you? A fait accompli: and I’m sure that George Abela is going to trip over himself in the rush to be led by a boy scout bravu tal-mama young enough to be his son.\\n“Whoever wins or loses must be prepared to toe the same line. This does not mean that I intend to bar any criticism but I think we should now start pulling the same rope. I see myself working in a team with all sorts of people.”\\nHe doesn’t intend to bar any criticism. Well, that must come as a relief to those who are waiting for Labour to take its first steps into the modern age. Funny he felt the need to say it, though, when that sort of thing is best left unsaid, because saying it speaks volumes about your mindset (“Look here, I am not going to ban criticism…”).\\nHe turns to the yelling charlatan for advice\\nThen there was a bit of waffle where he claims that Alfred Sant will want no role in the Labour Party. And another bit of waffle where he describes that shouting charlatan George Vella, whose insulting behaviour towards university students and their parents cost the Labour Party rather a lot of votes, as “one of the father figures of the party”. Well, no wonder the offspring is such a nasty mutant, then. Muscat explains that he regularly turns to Vella for advice. Oh dear God in heaven.\\nAnd I was right about something else (if I carry on this way I am going to be as smug as that prat): that Joseph Muscat will only take on the leadership if he is 100% certain that he will be prime minister in five years. He does not want to be Labour leader. He wants to be prime minister, and he is not going to give up his nice MEP life for anything less than that. Qed tara – I should have been a psychologist. Here’s what he said.\\n“It will be a pyrrhic victory just to win for the sake of leading the Labour Party.” Somebody explain to this chap what a pyrrhic victory is. “I’m interested in leading the Labour Party for its last term in opposition, and to then govern with a project. I look forward to being a Labour prime minister at 39.”\\nIf I were 14, I would stick my fingers into my mouth and make that retching gesture. Kemm hu antipatiku. Il-veru kaz. Tad-daqqiet ta’ harta. But he’s exactly the sort to go down like honey with those delegates who are impressed by Harvard certificates and irgiel tas-skola. Certificates in the Labour Party are perceived as an adequate substitute, nay as superior, to a sharp mind and political nous.\\nHe thinks he’s David Cameron\\nWhere I agree with Joseph Muscat is when he said that Labour should do what the British Labour Party did in 1994 with Tony Blair and what the Conservatives did more recently with David Cameron. Where we part company is in his belief that he is both Blair and Cameron rolled into one. The starting-point for both of them is that they come from extremely privileged backgrounds and they owe their self-confidence to that, rather than to strings of certificates used as a substitute for a sense of security or real intelligence. That will be the day: when the Malta Labour Party chooses a leader who went to St Edward’s, comes from a tal-pepe family, got sent off to an expensive boarding-school in England, and speaks with a smart accent. Not even the Nationalist Party would dare choose a leader like that. What does Joseph Muscat imagine Tony Blair is – a working-class kid made good? Kemm ma jafu xejn, jahasra.\\nAh, here’s more.\\n“I am not willing to waste time. We have to hit the ground running. I will change things drastically. Some things might not be liked. Others will.”\\nAnd he tells us that he has charisma – just in case we didn’t notice for ourselves\\nAnd then Herman asks whether Joseph sees himself in the mould of Lawrence Gonzi, “whose charm and charisma has managed to appeal even to some Socialists.” And the pr*** (not the word that ends in ‘t’ this time, but the other one) replies – hold your breath: “Well, as David Cameron once said, I think it won’t hurt anybody to have a young and charismatic leader.” Oh, yuk, really – since when has it been charismatic to call yourself charismatic? This fool has a lot to learn before he ‘hits the ground running.’\\nThen he tells us that he won’t shy away from any face-to-face confrontations with Gonzi. We know that already. After all, this twerp was doing in the 2003 campaign exactly the same job that Charlon Gouder did in this one. Do I take it that Charlon Gouder will be prime minister in 15 years time? One of my most vivid memories of the 2003 campaign was of Joseph Muscat shouting over Eddie Fenech Adami (the prime minister) and heckling him in a Broadcasting Authority debate, and it occurred to me how you could give a boy all the book-learning in the world, but without good manners or a sense of humour it’s just so much nothing.\\nJoseph Muscat: I did it My Way\\nHerman asked him whether he has any regrets, especially about that book on corruption that he wrote, for which he was sued by several people. His reply seized for him the crown of prattishness from Jason’s head.\\n“Regrets, I have a few. But then again, too few to mention.”\\nYes, really. That’s what he said. And he wasn’t been funny or ironic. Play it again, Frank. What a prize pair they make: Jason and Joseph. Zewg antipatici – put them together on a show and you’ll be able to hear the votes stampede away.\\nAnd now he’s reinvented himself as a member of the Yes camp\\nThen there’s the bit where he tells us that he is “pro-EU”. Yes, right. Ahem. And at that press conference I just mentioned, he was heckling and shouting at Fenech Adami because – you’ve guessed it – the big issue was EU membership and His Master’s Voice Joseph Muscat was dead set against it. To listen to him talk, the EU was hell on earth. Alla hares we should join. We might as well tie a stone around our necks and throw ourselves into the deep blue sea.\\nAnd then, like Sharon Ellul Bonici, the minute we joined he began trying to discover ways of working in Brussels, and became an MEP. That got him out of our hair for four years. But now he tells us that “the issue is over and done with” and that Labour is a “European party” that will be “pro-European”. It’s a bit like the Nazis turning Nazi-hunters, isn’t it? You just wouldn’t trust them. People are naturally and understandably suspicious of those whose views go in the diametrically opposite direction, literally overnight, because the occasion so demands.\\nAnd then he refers to himself in the third person once more, like his ex-AN namesake Josie Muscat loved to do in his public speeches.\\n“With Joseph Muscat as leader, it’s not talk. It’s fact. I have worked in the European Parliament” – ar’hemm, hej – “and the results I managed to obtain are evident.” No, they’re not, actually, and he’d better remind us.\\n“With Joseph Muscat as leader, Labour would have crossed the Rubicon definitely.” For an explanation of what he means, go to Wikipedia: Rubicon.\\nOh yuk, and yuk again. Yuk until the cows come home. He urgently needs an adviser who should tell him to stop sounding off and blowing his own trumpet. It’s so off-putting, really. And that’s where you realise what a lot of growing up he still has to do, despite fathering twins, despite ‘working in Brussels’, despite everything. He’s not Tony Blair. He’s not David Cameron. And he’s not JFK. He’s a kid with pretensions.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nEarlier today, I wrote about the interview Joseph Muscat gave to The Sunday Times in his role as fait-accompli leader of the Labour Party and Maltese prime minister of 2013. I said that he’s like Jason but with some brains.\\nGod bless Internet archives. Some sharp person sent us a link to an interview Jason Micallef gave to Malta Today on 16 November 2003, meta ddebutta bhala segretarju generali. The gloss has worn off him somewhat since that day. The bit where he talks about welcoming dissenters into the fold with loving arms is particularly hilarious after the way he spoke to Sharon EB and Anna Mallia, and about George Abela, on Xarabank some days ago (“We are asking those who left us to come back and in some instances we are even prepared to lower our heads and go to them ourselves.”).\\nThe similarity to the Poodle’s (capital P, now that he is so important) interview is striking. Here it is.\\nJason’s new beginning at Mile end\\nAt 32 Jason Micallef is one of the youngest persons to have held the post of secretary general. Here he speaks to Kurt Sansone about the party’s relationship with the media, past mistakes and future challenges.\\nA number of people including former MPs who fell out with the Labour Party over the last five years have said they are ready to work with the new Labour administration and discussions have already started with some individuals on possible avenues of collaboration. The new MLP secretary general, Jason Micallef says there are positive signs from people who may have not seen the party in a good light over recent years. What a difference a week makes in politics. I meet the new Labour Party secretary general Jason Micallef seven days after interviewing Jimmy Magro in the same office on the third floor.\\nTheir initials may be the same, but in every other respect a whiff of change seems to have wafted over the large glasshouse in Hamrun. For starters, Jimmy’s pet budgie is no longer present and on top of the television set sits an effigy of Mr Micallef’s favourite Manchester United player Ruud van Nistelrooy.The TV is set on international news and music from a private radio station provides background atmosphere.The media man he is, Mr Micallef points out that he has to be au courant with what is being reported on other stations including international news channels.\\nWe get down to business and I ask him whether Labour’s new buzz word ‘inclusiveness’ is simply just that. “It is not a buzz word. We are offering all the space possible to those who may have sympathised with us in the past, even those that held official positions and who for some reason or another were irked by certain attitudes of the party in the past years. My appeal is simple. All those who have something to offer the Labour Party, or who want to support the party have all the space to do so. We are asking those who left us to come back and in some instances we are even prepared to lower our heads and go to them ourselves.”\\nIt may be right to talk of inclusiveness, but people won’t come back unless there is something different to attract them to the party. Mr Micallef agrees, but he is confident things have changed. “We have managed to elect an administration that is by and large composed of new faces. In the leadership we have two new deputy leaders and Alfred Sant is still young in political terms. There has also been a change in the way politics is conducted. We are exploring the reasons why certain people were irked, we will discuss matters and move on.”\\nMr Micallef believes that most of the clashes were personality based. “Rather than policy differences, in most cases it was an issue of people not seeing eye to eye with each other,” he says. Mr Micallef adds that the party has suffered from lack of unity for too long and putting this right is one of the priorities for the new Administration. On whether dissent is an ailment that is associated solely with the Labour Party, Mr Micallef is convinced that in closed quarters the Nationalist Party has similar arguments and internal conflicts. “It is in the nature of all political parties on the left of the political spectrum to be predisposed to hang their washing outside. I am absolutely against externalising conflict. Once a decision or a vote has been taken internally one cannot go and write in newspapers and expose the conflict. For me, that is unacceptable. There are internal structures where anybody can push forward his or her argument or criticism. But once a vote is taken every member of this party has to abide by the decision. With Dr Sant’s arrival in 1992 in terms of argumentation and discussion things took a different turn. Whereas in Mintoff’s era there was hesitation to contest decisions taken, Dr Sant opened up the party to more internal discussion. But I also think that some took advantage of the new situation (mis-seba hadu l-id) and eventually from liberty it became libertinage. I have to add that part of the fault could have been due to the attitude adopted by the previous administration. When we had people exposing conflict in public, the party’s reaction was harsh, we either used our media to reply, or cut them off immediately. Adopting a different approach could have helped more.”\\nI ask Mr Micallef about the vigilance and discipline board of the Party, which has not been seen as the ideal of structures. The new secretary general says the time has come for the Board to be restructured, but when I ask him about Alfred Mifsud’s case he refrains from commenting. “I was not part of the administration when the issue cropped up, but I have to point out that the Board is autonomous from the party and many a times we wouldn’t know of the complaints brought in front of it.” Back to Mr Micallef’s pet subject, the media, and he admits that certain elements within the party might have irked the media with their behaviour. “They were reacting to media criticism, but in today’s times you have to be less intelligent to create a war with the media. I sympathise with the media and am very conscious of its workings. But I am confident that everybody has their own personal agenda. You cannot be working with someone who gives you guidelines and say that you have no agenda. The relationship between the Labour Party and the media has to be one based on respect. This is a game, we can agree and disagree but definitely if we do not agree we don’t need to embark on crusades.”\\nThe Labour Party has been accused of sidelining the discussion on the report drawn up by an independent commission on the reasons that led to a second defeat at the polls. The outgoing administration and national executive had unanimously decided to leave the analysis to the new administration. Mr Micallef insists the report has not been forgotten. “The new administration has not yet met and discussed the report, but it will be one of its first priorities. We will evaluate it and take the necessary measures to implement the changes identified. It may be the case that in the report there are suggestions that could have been dealt with already by the general conference that has just ended.”\\nThe general conference was a bubbly affair that ended with champagne glasses after the compromise reached with Dr Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici on the EU motions. However, some have suggested that the compromise might lead to a problem of interpretation in the future. I ask Mr Micallef whether it would have been better had the conference taken an actual vote to close the chapter once and for all, but he is of a different opinion. “Nobody can predict the future. It has been a long time since we had a general conference where people sported beaming faces. We emerged united because everybody won. I have no indication that the compromise reached with Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici will create problems in the future.”\\nBut what is his personal interpretation? “Everybody in the Labour Party is accepting the new reality that Malta will be an EU member state as of 1 May 2004. Naturally we will be insisting that government make the best of the advantages EU membership offers, but we will also be vigilant to the disadvantages that may come our way especially those that negatively affect workers.” Mr Micallef insists that the Labour Party has to make sure that government drafts plans to create job opportunities, to attract foreign direct investment and stimulate tourism. “We need to create work and not with empty promises. This country has big problems. Since my appointment my main appeal towards government has been to forget the EU issue. It is now resolved, it is a closed chapter. The Labour Party has accepted that it will work within the new reality. It is time now for government to start dealing with domestic problems. Everything indicates that this budget will be hard on workers and in these circumstances the Labour Party will monitor the situation to make certain that workers don’t shoulder all the burden.”\\nMr Micallef laughs when I ask him to comment on the Prime minister’s statement that the forthcoming budget will be the Opposition’s first test.\\n“When the Prime minister publicly admits that his administrations over the last 16 years caused the huge deficit and when he apologises to the public for bringing the country to the state it is in now, the Labour Party will then co-operate to solve the problems. I don’t know if the Prime minister was being sarcastic when he made that statement. What it means is that the Prime minister is asking the Opposition to agree with government on the austerity measures to be taken in the next budget. First we have a disaster brought about by bad administration like the Gozo Channel company where we had the minister for Gozo employing people only to have the current chairman say that the situation is now unsustainable. We also have PBS where successive Nationalist administrations ran the station and there was tremendous waste. Similar situations can be found at Air Malta, the civil service, the Mater Dei hospital… how can the prime minister be credible now when he says that the first test of the Opposition is to agree with government’s austerity measures? We cannot agree with him, we are taking him for a joke.”\\nMr Micallef is confident that in five year’s time the Labour Party will be in government. “These are exciting times even if we are in the Opposition. Renewal always brings exciting times. The average age of the administration has come down drastically and we have a similar mentality. We talk of our kids and other family issues. The atmosphere is vibrant and in political terms we have a young leadership.\\n“If we manage to transmit the atmosphere created within the party to the people outside, I am convinced that people will trust us with government.”\\nTo know why Labour lost this general election (among a hundred other reasons) just read the last paragraph. Jason & Co thought they were onto a winning streak because the average age of the administration came down drastically (as did the IQ level, I suspect); they had a similar mentality (bad news) and talked about their kids and other family issues, while creating a vibrant atmosphere at the office. How could they not win?\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nThe arguments are on as to whether the new Labour leader Joseph Muscat is pro-EU membership or not. He describes himself as pro-EU, which is not the same thing. Some commentators on this blog are saying that he is anti-EU, by which I take it they mean anti-EU membership for Malta.\\nSomebody who seems to know him weighed in to say that he is ‘definitely not anti-EU’, and that he adopted the anti-EU position only to survive politically within the Labour Party.\\nMy response was that this damns him by confirming him as a Class A opportunist, who fought against a cause he believed in, if he really believed in it, purely to achieve his own narrow political ambitions. What this ‘friend’ of Joseph Muscat is saying, in effect, is that though he believed Malta should join the EU, he fought in Sant’s fervently anti-EU trenches because there he could climb to the top.\\nIf he was pro-membership, then he’s one hell of a good liar and actor. As just one example, read this article which he wrote for L-orizzont in the week that we voted in the referendum. He tells his readers that the referendum result isn’t binding, and gives them a little graphical explanation of how to tick the No box.\\nWell, as long as he has charm and charisma (he says, though I have yet to find them), we shouldn’t bother that we’re going to get ourselves a Poodle (capital P, remember now) Weathervane as prime minister.\\nAs an older relative of mine likes to say about others of a similar type: ghandhu wiccu u x’imkien iehor l-istess.\\nResponsabbiltà\\nminn Joseph Muscat\\nNhar is-Sibt huwa jum importanti ghal pajjizna.

If you have no leadership qualities you can become a leader but you can forget about staying one because you’ve got a problem there.\\nJoseph Muscat is a natural follower, so by default he’s not a leader. He’s one of those people who get ahead by clinging to the petticoats of others, and who have no true identity of their own. He clung to Sant, he tells us that George Vella was a mentor, I know that Mario Vella ex-MDC was another mentor, and here he explains how Joe Debono Grech was his figura paterna.\\nYou have to hand it to the kid – he sure knows how to choose them.\\nF’Joe Debono Grech nibqa’ napprezza l-inkoraggiment kbir li tani u liz-“zghar” l-ohrajn minhabba l-eccitament li kellna qabel ma ndirizzajna l-mass meetings. Joe kien figura paterna.\\n– Joseph Muscat, L-orizzont (23 June 2004)\\nStrange bedfellows\\nWhen Sharon Ellul Bonici was turned down as a Labour candidate for the European Parliament elections, she was represented before the party’s Vigilance and Discipline Board by none other than former police inspector Anglu Farrugia. Perhaps he made one of those famously ferocious speeches that he boasts about on his website www.anglufarrugia.com. How I would have loved to be there. It’s a good thing you don’t have to use spelling and punctuation when you argue ferociously.\\nWhy am I bringing this up after four years? Well, looking back at all these alliances and power configurations is very interesting in the light of what’s going on now. I love seeing them all shafting each other. It’s a whole lot better than watching them shaft the country.\\nMrs Ellul Bonici was last seen fighting in public on television with that Jason Micallef. Anglu Farrugia was last seen on this blog, riding an elephant.\\nLet’s see now whether Mrs Ellul Bonici backs him in his bid for the leadership against Joseph Muscat. That should ruin his chances.\\nNow we can all sit back and watch the fur and feathers fly as Poodle-helped-by-chicken tackles Lion tackles Peacock tackles the-man-with-the-elephant.\\nBring out the popcorn.\\nWhat a difference the right sort of vacancy makes\\nGod bless the Internet and on-line access to newspaper archives. Just Google Joseph Muscat and all kinds of riches pop up. Here’s the new leader of the Labour Party, in an interview with Malta Today (6 January 2002):\\n“Would I consider going out for general elections? Definitely not. You see, I have another theory that to stand for the general elections you must be either a robber, a missionary or just plain crazy. I don’t think I’m any of these. And I don’t really like the local system where you find yourself standing against candidates who have the same ideology as you do. With all its disadvantages I prefer the first past the post system the way it works in England. At least that way you are fighting against candidates who have opposing ideologies to yours. Having said that I do admire those who have the guts to contest the elections.”\\nGosh, it’s a good thing he’s going to be co-opted into parliament then, isn’t it? Then like others before him Who Shall Not Be Mentioned, he can contest the 2013 general election as party leader, and get 14000 personal votes without competing for them. Wonderful.

They’d really like to adopt a down ‘n’ dirty x’gharukaza tack of the kind that they know how to do so well, but there’s just one little problem.\\nGeorge Micallef is a Labour sympathiser. You know, one of those Labour sympathisers that the vicious Nationalist government which refuses to work with anyone but Nationalists left on in his post and appointed him chairman of this and chairman of that. Karmenu Vella, in between renting out flats to the Freeport and dispatching Mrs Mangion to cash the cheques so that they wouldn’t have to be declared for income tax, appointed Micallef as his consultant at the Ministry of Tourism when Sant was busy having that brief flirtation with government.\\nAha, and guess what? Micallef also spearheaded the Bugibba project which will go down in Maltese political history as Sant’s monument to public works: a promenade plagued with more cost and time over-runs than an entire airport.\\nThese parts of his CV are being ignored by Miss Miriam Dalli and Charlon Gouder. Of course.\\nAnd if you click on this link, you’ll find something quite interesting. The Malta Tourism Authority set up an Eco-Certification Scheme and appointed a board called the Green Commission to oversee its administration. Guess who was chairman of the board?

The dance schools employed 109 persons and generated a financial surplus of €391,836. The office said participants in dance activities in 2007 increased by 8 percent over 2006 while the number of dance schools grew from 32 in 2006 to 34. Female dancers preferred classical ballet and jazz, whilst Latin American and ballroom were the most popular forms of dance amongst males. The majority of persons attending dance lessons were aged between 5 and 14, with the smallest percentage of persons being under the age of 5. Recurrent expenditure by the dance schools in 2007 amounted to €654,318, of which 45 per cent went towards staff costs. A significant proportion of the expenditure also went towards premises (including rent of premises) and operational expenditure. The total income generated in the same year reached €1,046,154. Of this, 85 per cent came from tuition fees, and a further 13 per cent came from dance shows, as shown in Table 11.

Here’s a paparazzi shot of the departing pachiderm. Let’s hope it doesn’t sue him for palimony, or Anglu is screwed (ooops).\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nFor those of you who wish to model yourselves on Metrosexual 1, the future prime minister of Malta (Metrosexual 2 prefers the clean-shaven look), here are some instructions on how to grow your very own goatee.\\nIf you’re a bit short on time, here’s another useful link.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOne of my collaborators has dug this little nugget out of the Internet archives. It’s an article by Issa Daqshekk Tony ‘Maltova’ Zarb, written for L-orizzont about the day Joseph Muscat (Metrosexual 1) stormed out of the European Parliament. There were no Maltese-English interpreters and he wanted to speak Maltese.\\nPity they don’t teach classes in style at the university he went to. This is what David Cameron would have done, if David Cameron were Maltese. He would have said: “Don’t you have any interpreters? Fine, then I’ll speak English.” And he would have proceeded to do so.\\nOnly people with a village-pride mentality (and unfortunately, it’s permeated all the way through our political class) would have the sheer lack of manners to throw a tantrum and inconvenience others about the lack of people who can interpret Maltese to English, when they are perfectly capable of speaking English in the first place.\\nI would go one further, and say that the ability to speak English fluently, besides your own language, is one up on all those other MEPs who can’t. English isn’t just a national language; it’s also the lingua franca. Speaking it in the European Parliament instead of your own language when no interpreters are available doesn’t mean eroding your national status or kowtowing to the British. It means you know how to do something that others can’t. And it shows you have good manners. Storming out in a fuss, on the other hand, means that you definitely don’t come from the same kind of background as Tony Blair and David Cameron, except in your dreams.\\nLet’s put it this way. If Maltova Zarb thinks it was a stylish thing to do, then it certainly wasn’t.\\nHamis 2 ta’ Gunju 2005\\nProsit Joseph\\nminn Tony Zarb, Segretarju Generali tal-GWU\\nNhar il-Gimgha qrajt b’interess il-pozizzjoni li ha l-Membru Parlamentari Ewropew Joseph Muscat meta dan, wara li pprotesta telaq ‘il barra mill-Parlament Ewropej ghax huwa ma nghatax l-opportunità li jitkellem bil-lingwa Maltija u dan ghax ma kienx hemm interpreti.\\nLil Joseph nghidulu prosit ghax mhux sew li wara hafna ftahir li l-lingwa Maltija kienet giet accettata bhala lingwa ufficjali fl-Unjoni Ewropea, imbaghad ikun impossibbli li wiehed jitkellem bil-lingwa Maltija.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, March 26th, 2008 at 8:15 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, March 26th, 2008 at 8:27 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nEvarist Bartolo wins the leadership election, and puts the remains of Metrosexual 1 and 2 to good use.

Over on one of the threads, there’s a big discussion going on about the sorts of men that women find attractive, and the sorts of men we don’t. This was sparked off by the belief of some in the Labour Party (and of Metrosexual 1 himself) that he is charismatic, charming and the kind of man that women go wild for. When I wrote that the only people who think Joseph Muscat is attractive to women are other heterosexual men, a bunch of men on this blog got cross with me for assuming that they don’t know what women like.\\nTo avoid any more misunderstandings of this nature, and to explain to the Labour Party what women find attractive in a man, I am posting pictures of nine all-time greats. You will notice that they have nothing in common with our future prime minister.

I’m posting the piece in full over here, because it gives us plenty of insight into why Joseph Muscat thinks he would make an excellent prime minister, why the head honchos at the Labour Party and the GWU agree, and why the Labour Party has spent the last four decades trying to get its act together and failing miserably. Interestingly, the tests were rooted in logic, English grammar and a sense of humour. I found that enthralling because those are the same three keys I used to detect whether a person is truly intelligent or merely an assiduous accumulator of knowledge and a clever book-learner type. This puts lots of MPs in an entirely new light: they think they can be politicians because they don’t recognise their own inadequacies. The one on the elephant springs immediately to mind. And oh gosh, I love the find that “incompetent individuals are less able to recognise competence in others.” How many of us have had this battle with clients who hire us for our skills and then proceed to tell us how to do our job? How many people seethe at their desk while carrying out a task the wrong way instead of the right way because the boss thinks she knows better? Oh well, just console yourselves: the Labour Party has far greater problems with incompetents who don’t realise what a mess they’re in.\\nIncompetent People Really Have No Clue, Studies Find\\nThey’re blind to own failings, others’ skills\\nErica Goode – New York Times (Archive)\\nThere are many incompetent people in the world. Dr. David A. Dunning is haunted by the fear that he might be one of them. Dunning, a professor of psychology at Cornell, worries about this because, according to his research, most incompetent people do not know that they are incompetent. On the contrary. People who do things badly, Dunning has found in studies conducted with a graduate student, Justin Kruger, are usually supremely confident of their abilities — more confident, in fact, than people who do things well.\\n“I began to think that there were probably lots of things that I was bad at, and I didn’t know it,'” Dunning said. One reason that the ignorant also tend to be the blissfully self-assured, the researchers believe, is that the skills required for competence often are the same skills necessary to recognize competence. The incompetent, therefore, suffer doubly, they suggested in a paper appearing in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it,” wrote Kruger, now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, and Dunning.\\nThis deficiency in ‘self-monitoring skills’, the researchers said, helps explain the tendency of the humor-impaired to persist in telling jokes that are not funny, of day traders to repeatedly jump into the market — and repeatedly lose out — and of the politically clueless to continue holding forth at dinner parties on the fine points of campaign strategy.\\nIn a series of studies, Kruger and Dunning tested their theory of incompetence. They found that subjects who scored in the lowest quartile on tests of logic, English grammar and humor were also the most likely to ‘grossly overestimate’ how well they had performed. In all three tests, subjects’ ratings of their ability were positively linked to their actual scores. But the lowest-ranked participants showed much greater distortions in their self-estimates.\\nAsked to evaluate their performance on the test of logical reasoning, for example, subjects who scored only in the 12th percentile guessed that they had scored in the 62nd percentile, and deemed their overall skill at logical reasoning to be at the 68th percentile. Similarly, subjects who scored at the 10th percentile on the grammar test ranked themselves at the 67th percentile in the ability to ‘identify grammatically correct standard English’, and estimated their test scores to be at the 61st percentile.\\nOn the humor test, in which participants were asked to rate jokes according to their funniness (subjects’ ratings were matched against those of an ‘expert’ panel of professional comedians), low-scoring subjects were also more apt to have an inflated perception of their skill. But because humor is idiosyncratically defined, the researchers said, the results were less conclusive.\\nUnlike unskilled counterparts, the most able subjects in the study, Kruger and Dunning found, were likely to underestimate their competence. The researchers attributed this to the fact that, in the absence of information about how others were doing, highly competent subjects assumed that others were performing as well as they were — a phenomenon psychologists term the ‘false consensus effect’.\\nWhen high-scoring subjects were asked to ‘grade’ the grammar tests of their peers, however, they quickly revised their evaluations of their own performance. In contrast, the self-assessments of those who scored badly themselves were unaffected by the experience of grading others; some subjects even further inflated their estimates of their own abilities. “Incompetent individuals were less able to recognize competence in others”, the researchers concluded.\\nIn a final experiment, Dunning and Kruger set out to discover if training would help modify the exaggerated self-perceptions of incapable subjects. In fact, a short training session in logical reasoning did improve the ability of low-scoring subjects to assess their performance realistically, they found.\\nThe findings, the psychologists said, support Thomas Jefferson’s assertion that “he who knows best knows how little he knows”. And the research meshes neatly with other work indicating that overconfidence is common; studies have found, for example, that the vast majority of people rate themselves as “above average” on a wide array of abilities — though such an abundance of talent would be impossible in statistical terms. This overestimation, studies indicate, is more likely for tasks that are difficult than for those that are easy.\\nSuch studies are not without critics. Dr. David C. Funder, a psychology professor at the University of California at Riverside, for example, said he suspects that most lay people have only a vague idea of the meaning of “average” in statistical terms. “I’m not sure the average person thinks of `average’ or `percentile’ in quite that literal a sense”, Funder said, “so `above average’ might mean to them `pretty good’, or `OK’, or `doing all right’. And if, in fact, people mean something subjective when they use the word, then it’s really hard to evaluate whether they’re right or wrong, using the statistical criterion.”\\nBut Dunning said his current research and past studies indicated there are many reasons why people would tend to overestimate their competency and not be aware of it. In various situations, feedback is absent, or at least ambiguous; even a humorless joke, for example, is likely to be met with polite laughter. And faced with incompetence, social norms prevent most people from blurting out “You stink!” — truthful though this assessment may be.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n(and no, I don’t mean Johnny tal-Kruz Xipp)\\nIs a project wrong because it is wrong, or is it wrong because the land belongs to an MP? I’m not asking because I want a philosophical discussion while we’re all supposed to be at work.\\nNo. I ask because I wonder sometimes about the way the Labour Party rationalises things (“If it can win us some votes, we’ll do it.”). So while they’re making all that fuss about a putative nightclub down at Mistra Bay, here’s what is happening up on Mistra ridge. An environmental planning statement has been released for a proposed 1,000 flats, 4,500 square metres of retail area, parking for 2,202 cars, and a 13-storey tower on the site of the former Mistra Village.\\nMistra Village was a low-rise complex landscaped into the area and set back from the edge of the ridge. Then bit by bit, hideous blocks of apartments began to creep up and over the ridge and now we have this proposal.\\nThe environmental planning statement says that this ridge – called the Bajda Ridge – is designated as an area of high landscape value (though I would say it’s already quite late for that), and that the development will be highly detrimental to this. “The changes to the views from most areas are of minor significance, but the changes from Mistra Bay are considered to be of major significance,” the statement says.\\nApparently, a 19-storey tower had been proposed earlier, but there was a ‘public outcry’. Really? Sorry, but I hadn’t noticed. It can’t have been as great as the outcry about the nightclub down in the bay, but maybe that’s because the land isn’t owned by an MP. Now a ‘boomerang’ shaped building that steps up from six to 13 storeys and back down to six is being proposed instead.\\nSo maybe this is the one we should be talking about, and asking ourselves why the Labour Party hasn’t said anything yet.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nTsk tsk tsk. Metrosexual 2 wears brown casual shoes with a dark suit and now here’s Metrosexual 1, strapping his watch over his cuff and wearing a chav bracelet on his right wrist. Well, what can I say? It would have to be a Labour leader to do something like that. Not that I want you to think I’m a snob or anything – but you can have all the university degrees in the world, and it’s always going to be the details that trip you up.\\n\\nWhen we call for the style police, we don’t expect them to have to deal with such fundamental matters.\\nSo here are some simple instructions for the metrosexuals of the Labour Party.\\nDark suit – plain black lace-up shoes with a thin sole; absolutely not patent leather; NEVER to be worn with pale or white socks\\nWatch – strictly to be worn BENEATH your shirt-cuff; when you wish to know the time, push up your cuff; this can also be used as a signal that a meeting is over and you wish the annoying person sitting across from you to be on his way\\nBracelets – absolutely not allowed, unless they are made of shells and beads on a leather thong and worn over a sun-tan on the beach, when you are between 18 and 28.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Thursday, March 27th, 2008 at 9:56 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nUpdate: it turns out that I was wrong.\\nNorman Lowell was sentenced yesterday to two years in jail. The prison sentence is suspended for four years. This means that he stays out of jail, but the sentence goes on his record. If he is convicted of any other crime in the next four years, he goes to prison and serves that two-year sentence. He was convicted on three counts of inciting racial hatred and one of insulting the President of Malta.\\nThe latter crime is archaic and ridiculous, and we should be free to insult the president as much as we like. I suppose it takes all sorts. In the USA you can insult the president but God help you if you insult the flag. The British are best: they can insult everything and everyone and do so with impunity – except, of course, where racial hatred is concerned. Inciting racial hatred is another matter.\\nThat madman with the stick was fined EUR500, too. I suppose they can have a whip-around for him at one of their full-moon barbecues or their fenkati. His little friend Arlette Baldacchino can pass the hat around or sell Imperium Europa lapel pins on the Viva Malta website.\\nOne thing she won’t ever have to do again is canvass for him or fundraise for his electoral campaign, as she did in this last general election. His two-year prison sentence (he doesn’t have to serve it, but it’s still a conviction) means that he is barred under article 54 of the Constitution from ever contesting a general election again.\\n\\nNorman Lowell haranguing the media about the media\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 28th, 2008 at 10:02 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nBy Silvio Parnis \\nWe’ve just checked out Silvio Parnis’ website, after a hot tip, and oh, what treats.

The Nationalist Party won the 2008 general election by a slim margin of 1,500 votes over Labour.\\nDr Farrugia, a former police superintendent, told journalists that he prepared the report after many persons contacted him giving details indicating that the general election was “dominated by the buying of hundreds of votes.” He did not divulge details of the report presented to the Police Commissioner, but he revealed that at least two government ministers are amongst those mentioned in the vote buying cases.\\nThe report includes details such as the amounts paid to individuals, and specific political favours granted to others in the last few days before the general election, to make them vote for the Nationalist Party, the Labour MP said. The sums allegedly paid to buy votes range from €70 to €150, and in one case a bonus of €1,500 was paid. The report also gives specific details of government departments were police can find documents related to the allegations.\\n“There were hundreds of votes involved. Right now I cannot say anything else. I gave all information to the police. I received the information from persons who at first were afraid, but then felt the need to approach me and give me the information, which I now presented to police.”\\nDr Farrugia called on police to carry out a rigorous investigation. “I have no reason to doubt the Police Commissioner’s work. Thus I leave all in his hands now.”\\nMiskin il-paraventu. Il-veru kaz.

He must have been on Red Bull and espressos for the duration (we daren’t suggest anything stronger; he is a former policeman and current lawyer-politician, after all).\\nOh dear, poor Anglu. What he is saying is this: that ‘hundreds’ of Labour supporters valued their Labour support so poorly, and were so unmoved by the bzonn ta’ bidla, that they sold their vote for EUR70 – that’s Lm30 in old money. That’s how much they rated the prospect of Sant as prime minister. If I were Anglu tal-iljunfant, I wouldn’t shout about it too much.\\nMaybe Anglu should try giving one of his ‘famous ferocious speeches’ about this one, and see if it helps him pip the Poodle (capital P, now) to the post.\\nThe Malta Shipyards Song Contest\\n\\nYes, there really is such a thing. It was announced yesterday by means of a little piece in the ‘social and personal’ column of The Times. Here it is.\\nThe Malta Shipyards Sports and Social Club is organising the 19th edition of the Malta Shipyards Singers’ Contest, a festival for Maltese singers in aid of Ir-Razzett tal-Ħbiberija (Park of Friendship) in Marsascala. The contest will be held over two evenings, the first on June 6 and the final on July 12. Singers taking part may sing works by Maltese authors and composers. These songs need not be new, however these would not have been used during the 18th edition (2007). There will be five age categories. Application forms and rules of the contest can be obtained from Nicholas Balzan, Club Secretary, Malta Shipyards, Cospicua (tel: 2399 2069), and from [email\\xa0protected] The closing date for applications is April 11. The club is also launching its official website www.maltashipyardssocial.com.\\nThis being a shipyard song contest, perhaps it is the perfect occasion for the redoubtable Mary Spiteri to give another sparkling rendition of My Heart Will Go On, the theme song from the film Titanic, starring Kate Winslett and Leonardo di Caprio. The last time she did that was at Alfred Sant’s final mass meeting before the 2003 general election. In a moment of ill-advised crassness, the lady dedicated the song to Eddie Fenech Adami – hoping, she said to the screeching crowd, that he ‘would sink like the Titanic.’ That was a memorable day for her scrapbook.\\nSadly, we don’t have the YouTube video in question (is there one?), but we can provide you with some other Mary Spiteri entertainment here.\\n\\nThe coronation of the Poodle\\n\\n‘I anoint you leader of the Malta Labour Party; take this wig and wear it as a symbol of your sovereignty.’\\nSomebody posted this amusing comment on one of the threads:\\n“Perhaps on the day of the formal installation of the Poodle-Mexxej, they’ll hold a coronation ceremony at Mile End, in which Sant will solemnly remove his wig and place it upon the head of the Anointed One.”\\nGod, I laughed so much at this little vignette that I ended up with a keyboard full of green tea.\\nLots of you noticed from the ‘brazzuletta u arlogg’ photo that the Poodle-Mexxej is suffering from the effects of – how should I put it? – a little thatch-thinning. There are lots of unfortunate jokes about whether he’ll be emulating his mentor in this department, too. So we’ve found some suitable models that might just serve the purpose.\\nOh, and by the way – liberal use of hair gel causes hair loss.

This is what article 54 (Disqualification for membership of the House of Representatives) of the Constitution says:\\n(1) No person shall be qualified to be elected as a member of the House of Representatives –\\n(f) if he is under sentence of death imposed on him by any court in Malta or is serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called), exceeding twelve months imposed on him by such a court or substituted by competent authority for some other sentence imposed on him by such a court;\\nBy 2013, the suspension of his two-year sentence will be up. I’m sorry to disappoint you (I’m very disappointed myself). I should have read that article back again before writing.\\nThat font of all parliamentary knowledge, Fausto Majjistral, has come to the rescue with the relevant clause from the European Parliament Elections Act, to let us know whether Norman Lowell can or cannot stand for the MEP elections next year.\\n19. (1) Without prejudice to the provisions of the Act, no person shall be qualified to stand for election as a member of the European Parliament or, if elected, to remain a member thereof if, whether in Malta or in any other Member State –\\n(e) he is serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) exceeding twelve months imposed on him by a court in a Member State or is under such a sentence of imprisonment the execution of which has been suspended;\\nIn other words, no – Norman Lowell can’t stand for the MEP elections next year, because he will still be “under such a sentence of imprisonment the execution of which has been suspended.’\\nNow it’s his turn and that of his little friend Arlette Baldacchino to be sorely disappointed.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWell, neither am I – but I do know the difference between a rudder and a tiller. Most sensible people do.\\nAnthony Licari, on the other hand, either doesn’t know or believes that the prime minister is fond of some dangerous underwater action, clinging to the rudders of speeding boats while wearing goggles and a pair of flippers.\\nDr Licari reminds us beneath each of his columns in The Times that he teaches psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and geolinguistics at the department of French of the University of Malta. And yet he doesn’t know the difference between a tiller and a rudder.\\nThis is what he wrote about the prime minister: “One may be a strong person with two sturdy hands on the rudder..”.\\nHmmmm. This makes me less surprised that he has mistaken Joseph Muscat for a suitable prime minister for Malta, and the man to take the Labour Party (a decade too late) into the 21st century.\\nAnthony Licari is one of those who are backing the Poodle in the leadership race, along with Godfrey ‘I want both parties to love me’ Grima. Both of them backed his MEP election bid four years ago. Grima is now working on Muscat’s leadership campaign, and Licari is widely rumoured to have written those really stupid advertisements that appeared in the English-language newspapers during the general election campaign – the ones with Lawrence Gonzi ‘hiding’ ministers and some rubbish text. I suppose the Labour Party, with its touching faith in university certificates, believed that a lecturer in psycholinguistics would be the ideal person to conceive and write electoral campaign advertisements.\\nAt least Licari didn’t mix the prime minister up with the leader of the opposition, but that’s a lot easier than working out the difference between a tiller and a rudder. One wears a wig and the other doesn’t.\\nSo just for your guidance, Mr – sorry, Dr – Licari: the rudder is that hinged bit stuck to the stern of a boat, half of which is underwater; the tiller is that long rod-like thing at the stern, but above water, attached to the rudder and used for steering. Here’s a picture.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, March 29th, 2008 at 3:50 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nSo Tone, what do you think of that leadership election, eh?\\nHere’s Dr Anthony Licari, who teaches psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and geolinguistics at the department of French of the University of Malta, in his column today in The Times:\\nI think that the new MLP leader should be young (a Methuselah of about 60 and leading till 75 is much too old), with a pleasant personality, trusted with a continuous party loyalty, possessing a very good academic level, a sensitivity towards the less fortunate, a total refusal of corruption, considerable successful foreign – especially European – experience and does not laugh too much. Above all, ultra-conservatism and the far-right will declare that Labour has made the wisest, brightest choice of a new leader in one case only. The leader has to be oldish, weakish, meekish and drab. In this way only would he be the most exciting promoter of insipid, masochistic, snoozing, democratic equilibrium.\\nSo if George Abela is a “Methuselah of about 60”, what does that make Alfred Sant, who turned the magic number last month?\\nAnd more to the point, what does it make Licari himself, who is about George Abela’s age if not older?\\nGhidli ma’ min taghmila, u nghidlek x’int. You can tell what sort of person Joseph Muscat is by the kind of backers he attracts. The same can be said of George Abela.\\nJoseph Muscat backed by Anthony Licari, Alfred Sant, Jason Micallef and Godfrey Grima. Oh, please. Time for some more green tea.\\n\\nAnglu, Evarist, Michael and George get together and deal with Joseph.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, March 29th, 2008 at 4:22 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, March 29th, 2008 at 4:24 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nOne of my collaborators has just emailed me to say that Dr Anthony J Licari, who teaches psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and geolinguistics at the department of French of the University of Malta and backs Joseph Muscat, celebrates his birthday on Monday (Jum il-Helsien – great for a Labour supporter).\\nAnd guess what? He turns 59. This is the man who described George Abela, without mentioning his name, as a Methuselah. It turns out he is even older than Abela.\\nI suppose he backs Muscat because he sees more opportunity for influence there. Joseph Muscat is 25 years younger than he is, probably sees him as a father figure, and Muscat is also a follower rather than a leader. With George Abela, somebody like Tony Licari (who teaches etc etc) can hope to get nowhere. Ma’ min rajtek xebbahtek, and Licari and Muscat are two of a kind – and completely different to Abela.\\nMy collaborator also tells me that Licari (who teaches etc etc) has married only recently a Russian bride some 30 years his junior. Let’s hope she doesn’t run off with Joseph Muscat. Ouch.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis article was first published in The Malta Independent last Thursday.\\nDom Mintoff anointed Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici as his successor, and now here we are, left in no doubt at all that Alfred Sant has anointed the man I dubbed Sant’s poodle way back in 1997. The name stuck, and now everyone uses it. Why? Because it’s so appropriate. It wouldn’t have dogged him (oops, sorry) for all these years if it wasn’t such a good fit.\\nJoseph Muscat has launched a pre-emptive strike that is designed to put off all competition. His massive, all-over-the-media campaign, at a time when absolutely no one else is figuring in the show, is his and Sant’s way of telling everyone: this is the Chosen One. All others keep out.\\nMuscat is speaking not as a contender for the leadership, but as the leader. He is not telling us what he wishes to do, but how he plans to do it. You have to hand it to the kid: he’s got it all sewn up. Six years ago, he gave an interview in which he said that he finds electoral politics distasteful, and that to his mind you have to be a robber or a missionary or just plain crazy to enter the game. Here it is, in his words, taken from Malta Today (6 January, 2002):\\n“Would I consider going out for general elections? Definitely not. You see, I have another theory that to stand for the general elections you must be either a robber, a missionary or just plain crazy. I don’t think I’m any of these. And I don’t really like the local system where you find yourself standing against candidates who have the same ideology as you do.”\\nIt’s a good thing he’s going to be co-opted into parliament, given that he thinks you have to be a robber (I suppose this is a literal translation of trid tkun halliel), a missionary or a candidate for the nuthouse to get your seat by working for it in a general election. Yes, he certainly has it all worked out. Then like others before him Who Shall Not Be Mentioned, he can contest the 2013 general election as party leader, and get 14,000 personal votes without competing for them – unlike all those other robbers, missionaries and madmen.\\nIncidentally, I wonder into which category he slots his mentor Alfred Sant? Missionary, no doubt. I won’t be too specific about my own view.\\nGod bless the Internet and on-line access to newspaper archives. Just Google Joseph Muscat and all kinds of riches pop up, like the reams he wrote during the EU referendum campaign, when he told us in great and painful detail of all the torture we would endure if Malta joined the union. He described in even greater detail the sort of paradise that Malta would be if we adopted the Great Leader’s Vizjoni ta’ Partnerxipp. This is the very man who has since spun round like a weathervane in a Force 9 gale, and who is trying so hard to convince us that he is the new European Wonderboy. What a shame that all of his articles are going to come back to haunt him. And haunt him. And haunt him some more.\\nJoseph Muscat is backed right up against that wall. If he continues to spout the nonsense that he did before the 2003 general election, we won’t trust his “European credentials”. If he does a little U-turn in the middle of this rather busy highway, he’s going to get mown down. And you know what happens to politicians who sit on the fence: they get spiked in a very inconvenient place.\\nWhen Sant said he was resigning irrevocably, there were people who read into his words the wider meaning that he would be heading off home to spend the rest of his days talking about turgid literature with Frans Sammut. Oh, how wrong they were. Before the election, I thought that if Labour lost again, the party would shake off Sant for good and go through much-needed reform. I thought that the Young Turks would force out the man and all those associated with him. I didn’t realise that the party’s Stalinist control methods have eradicated all Young Turks (of whatever ages) and strengthened the internal totalitarianism.\\nAfter the election, when I was luxuriating in the knowledge (I imagined) of not having to see Sant’s face on television again or hear that refrigerator-voice, something happened to shock me out of my reverie. It was the press conference Sant gave to announce his “irrevocable resignation”. “Oh my god,” I thought. “The man is staying on in the shadows. He’s going to anoint somebody and be a kingmaker.”\\nThe first person who sprang to mind as I sat horrified in front of the television, wondering why all the reporters were taking him at his word, was the little fluffy one. But I thought that they couldn’t hope to pull it off: foisting a 34-year-old who models himself on David Beckham, and with all the depth of a puddle in my backyard, on the Labour Party as the New Great White Hope was going to be an impossible feat. I reckoned without the gullibility and impressionability of the delegates – bad mistake, given that they had elected Sant on the strength of his Harvard certificate.\\nSo I thought The Chosen One would be Evarist Bartolo, with Joseph Muscat in the role of bridesmaid. As for the other bridesmaid, I worked out that Jason Micallef would make a perfect match for the other JM. Evarist could put one on either side and get them to smile for the cameras – in which case, the photographers would have to bring out their light meters.\\nOh, but I was wrong. They are going to pull it off. Joseph Muscat is going to steamroll, or be steamrolled, over everyone else to become the new Labour leader. The alternative to Lawrence Gonzi is going to be a 34-year-old know-it-all with the demeanour of an irritating twerp and an arani ma, kemm jien bravu’ attitude.\\nThe thing about Joseph Muscat is that he is a natural follower, not a natural leader. Children fall into one category or the other, and that is how we stay until we die. There is a third category, that of the loner. It is a small one, but strangely, it has provided us with the two most recent Labour leaders.\\nI’m not going to discuss all the respective characteristics of leaders and followers here. It’s not the place, and with the internet you can easily get all the information you want. There is one important characteristic, though, that I must point out. People who are natural leaders form independent opinions and hold those opinions irrespective of the dominant current. Rather than being swayed by the opinions of others, they sway others towards their opinion. Joseph Muscat, on the other hand, has spent his adult life being swayed by the opinion of whosoever happens to be his mentor at the time.\\nForever needing a mentor of one kind or another is another sign of a follower, too, and these are just some of the mentors that Joseph Muscat has listed in his many silly articles: Alfred Sant (the number one), George Vella, and Joe Debono Grech. Yes, he does know how to choose them. For a time, when he worked at Super One while Alfred Mifsud was in charge, and later when he went to work for Alfred Mifsud at Crystal Finance (as an investment advisor, if you please), Mifsud was a mentor too. But when Sant and Mifsud fell out, and Mifsud received a stern letter from the Labour Party’s Vigilance and Discipline Board, Muscat found it opportune to distance himself somewhat. Fortunately, he was elected MEP soon after, and so he didn’t have to set about looking for another job with another investment advisory company.\\nMeanwhile, Muscat is modelling his campaign on similar campaigns that we remember well – those of one A. Sant. His website is littered with his academic achievements and his dikris. While the undue obsession with letters after one’s name is a peculiarly Maltese (and Indian, I’m told) disease, in the Labour Party it appears to be particularly acute. If you were to try applying for a post with a corporation at the age of 34 or 60, by focussing only on your academic achievements and enclosing copies of your certificates, you would be crossed off the applicant list immediately. You wouldn’t even reach the interview stage. At that sort of age, what employers want to see is proof of activity and achievement in the real world.\\nYet Muscat and Sant insist on waving their dikris in the electorate’s face as a reason why they should be given the job of prime minister. Sant published his Harvard certificate in the book that his friend Frans Sammut wrote about him a couple of months ago. Can you imagine – a man of 60 waving his 1970s university certificate about to prove that he is the right man for the job?\\nAnd now here is his anointed one doing the same with his PhD. What is even more interesting is that Muscat, like Sant, is shoving in our faces his dikris in economics and management as evidence that he is fit to run the country. It’s the same sort of attitude you get in a third world state where 90 per cent of the population is illiterate and the man who went to university rules the roost. You know what they say, in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Ah, but that doesn’t apply to Malta in general. That applies to the Labour Party. Maybe this is the time to remind both Muscat and his mentor Sant that the prime minister who got Malta into the Eurozone, slashed the deficit and practically eliminated unemployment has exactly the same university degree as Anglu Farrugia, whose website seems to have been written using translation software. Go to www.anglufarrugia.com if you don’t believe me. Meanwhile, the man with the Harvard training in management did…well, I needn’t go on.\\n\\nThe biggest mistake that Muscat is making, one that only serves to emphasise how callow he is, is in talking as though he is already the party leader. He knows that his election is inevitable, but he should at least have the decency (and the brains) to pretend that it isn’t. Unfortunately, he has a lot in common with Jason Micallef – rather too much, I would say. They’re very similar.\\nHere’s Joseph Muscat, talking like it-tifel bravu tal-mama in his interview with The Sunday Times, last Sunday. If he is really going to be Malta’s next prime minister, he had better grow up fast or Malta is in big trouble. Here are some choice excerpts.\\n“I have a 15-year project for the party and the country. During a maximum five years in opposition, we will spend the first two years transforming the party…In the third and fourth years, we will tell people what we want to do. Experience has shown us that telling the electorate that the Nationalists have lied and are not delivering is not enough. People want to know what we are doing.”\\nDing-dong! Muscat has realised that the best way to win an election is to tell people what you are going to do, and not what the government is failing to do, because unless they are mentally incapacitated, they can see that for themselves. As for that 15-year plan, I suppose Muscat wrote it in the 10 days between Sant’s irrevocable resignation and last Sunday’s interview? Come on, who are we trying to kid here? The plan, if there is one and it is not just a figment of his imagination, must have long since been written.\\nHere the new Labour leader again: “The Labour Party has to map out a clear manifesto by the next election, so that the electorate knows where it stands on all issues.” Ding-dong again! Kemm hu bravu l-boy. Skopra l-Amerka. Yes, Joseph – and this time, make sure that it has no misprints, no computer malfunctions, and no items that have already been finalised by the government. You’ve got five years for writing and proof-reading. Start now.\\nLike his erstwhile namesake at Azzjoni Nazzjonali, Joseph Muscat speaks of himself in the third person, which is inevitably a warning sign. Look at this, for instance: “I will say it loud and clear – Joseph Muscat as leader of the Labour Party is an invitation for everybody to work together. Choosing Joseph does not mean excluding Michael or George.” Yes, I’m sure George Abela is going to trip over his own feet in his haste to be led by a boy scout with pretensions.\\nSomewhere, probably on my blog, and before he announced his candidature, I wrote that Joseph Muscat will only take on the party leadership if he is 100 per cent certain that he will be prime minister in five years’ time. He does not want to be Labour leader as such. He wants to be prime minister, and he is not going to give up his nice MEP life for anything less than that. I should have been a psychologist, because here’s what he told The Sunday Times: “It will be a pyrrhic victory just to win for the sake of leading the Labour Party.” Somebody explain to this chap what a pyrrhic victory is, because they clearly didn’t teach it in Economics and Business Administration. “I’m interested in leading the Labour Party for its last term in opposition, and to then govern with a project. I look forward to being a Labour prime minister at 39.”\\nHis grasp on history is so weak that he imagines he will be the youngest Maltese prime minister ever in the history of the world. It might come as a shock to him to learn that others got there first, including Mintoff and Borg Olivier – though it is heresy to compare I-want-to-be-Beckham to either of them (for different reasons).\\nThe self-aggrandising Muscat went on to dig himself deeper by describing himself as charismatic, apparently unaware that those who do so are by definition not so. He compares himself to Tony Blair and David Cameron, seeing himself as both rolled into one. He appears to be unaware that their self-assurance is not rooted in academic qualifications and certificates, but in an extremely privileged family background, schooling and upbringing. Maybe he actually thinks that the British Labour leader is a working-class kid made good, who went to elocution lessons and took training in table manners, rather than the son of considerable privilege. That will be the day – when Labour elects a tal-pepe person as leader. Not even the Nationalist Party has dared do that since Borg Olivier and the glamorous Swinging Sixties.\\nAh, here’s more presumption from the man who talks as though he is already elected: “I am not willing to waste time. We have to hit the ground running. I will change things drastically. Some things might not be liked. Others will.”\\nThen the interviewer asks him whether he sees himself in the mould of Lawrence Gonzi, “whose charm and charisma have managed to appeal even to some Socialists.” And Muscat replies: “Well, as David Cameron once said, I think it won’t hurt anybody to have a young and charismatic leader.” If your only selling-points are your age (it can work against you) and the fact that you think you’re charismatic when you are not, you’re a dead duck, mate. And charisma alone is worth nothing. Charles Manson had charisma, for heaven’s sake.\\nThe interviewer asked him whether he has any regrets, and Muscat’s reply was even worse than his Number One mentor’s. He actually quoted a couple of lines from My Way: “Regrets, I have a few. But then again, too few to mention.” Really, this is the stuff of which prime ministers are made. The next five years should be fun.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\nThe Labour Party appears to believe that the election of its new leader – as though it is not a foregone conclusion already – is purely an internal matter. The rest of us, it says, should stay out.\\nLabour supporters are all over the Internet telling us to mind our own business. Labour columnists like Norman Hamilton and Anthony Licari, both of The Times, are telling us how kind we are to offer advice – thanks but no thanks. Licari is arguing for Joseph Muscat (birds of a feather flock together) and against George Abela (ditto). He seems to think that his opinion is valid because he supports the Labour Party but mine, for example, is not.\\nOh how wrong these people are. Aside from the fact that the entire country has a vested interest in who becomes leader of the Labour Party, because he or she is a potential prime minister, the ‘market research’, so to speak, is being done the wrong way round. In its selection of the new leader – a false selection, because the leader is chosen already – the Labour Party is referring for a verdict to those who would vote Labour even if the party were to be led by a one-eyed singing monkey or Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici (or Alfred Sant, or even a twerp called Joseph Muscat). The market research is all internal, and therefore pointless.\\nIt is pointless because the new market for Labour is not among party delegates or among the Labour hardcore – that 47% or thereabouts of the electorate who will vote Labour out of blind loyalty, and who did so, incredibly, in 1981, 1987, and even 1992, when the party was still led by Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and they wanted him back to replace Fenech Adami as prime minister. No, the market is not there. The market is among people who don’t vote Labour, who didn’t vote Labour in this last election, and whose votes the Labour Party needs if it is going to win the next one. Labour must ask these people what they think about having Joseph Muscat as their potential prime minister, and if the reaction is one of horror or dismay now, the party can rest assured that it will be one of horror or dismay in 2013. The party may struggle to change these people’s minds, but why on earth begin with a deficit of trust and make the next five years an uphill battle?\\nIn the on-line poll run by The Times, George Abela far outstripped Joseph Muscat as the readers’ choice. In a similar poll before the general election, when readers were asked who they preferred as prime minister, Gonzi polled something like 71% of the votes while Sant polled 29%. These proportions stayed more or less consistent even though the number of voters increased by the thousand or so every day. So here the Labour Party has a pretty good idea that readers of The Times on-line, who in their very vast majority prefer Lawrence Gonzi, also prefer George Abela to Joseph Muscat. Because Labour needs the people who voted for Lawrence Gonzi this time if it is to win next time, it had better pick up this clue to success. Another clue it should pick up is that large numbers of people stayed at home rather than vote Labour in the last election, because they didn’t want Sant as prime minister. Are they likely to vote for a Sant clone and acolyte? The party can be sure that the Nationalists will spend the next five years reminding the electorate that Joseph Muscat is sewn into the hem of Sant’s petticoat.\\nSo why isn’t the Labour Party asking us? There are two simple answers to that question. The first is that we are telling them, whether they ask us or not, something that they do not want to hear: that the new leader should be George Abela. They don’t want George Abela; they’ve been told to want Joseph Muscat. Unfortunately, what they are hearing from the I-don’t-vote-Labour-but-Labour-needs-my-vote camp is that Joseph Muscat is a twerp with pretensions, and he can have all the university certificates in the world but we still don’t trust his judgement. Also, we don’t like the fact that he sailed to the top by being obedient to Sant, by abstaining in the referendum because Sant told him to do so, and by spending the run-up to that referendum frightening people about the consequences of EU membership and trying to sell them Sant’s skewed vision of ‘partnership’. All this, if you please, from somebody who, like his mentor before him, is waving his university degrees in economics and business administration in our faces as proof that he is qualified to run the country. In response to this, all I can say is that the man with the Harvard DBA in business management ran the country into the ground in 22 months and got the EU membership issue all wrong, while the man with the same university degree as Anglu Farrugia took us into the Eurozone and practically killed off unemployment.\\nThe second answer is that the Labour Party isn’t too hot on strategy. In the Labour way of doing things, strategy means pussyfooting around for five years, then flinging mud around for the first five weeks of an election campaign, visiting Buskett and Kennedy Grove and the Paraventu with the press in tow, and renaming your 12-year-old Cittadinmobil the kowc tal-bidla. Then when you’ve run out of ‘ideas’, you sit back and hope that some party mole in a private corporation will come across a copy of a notarial contract that a nightclub promoter has shown the mole’s bosses in the hope of securing a sponsorship deal, and that the mole will come running to you with it so that you can wave it around in the prime minister’s face on the last day of the campaign. And of course you will have to hope that nobody asks why the first page of the contract is missing, so that you don’t have to tell them that your mole removed the first page, which was stamped ‘Received on’ followed by the date and the name of the private corporation for which he works. You don’t want the private corporation starting an internal inquiry to remind its employees that their first loyalty is to their employer and not to the Labour Party.\\nWe are speaking here of a secretary-general who comes across as the male equivalent of a dumb chick, who even after the election had come and gone was still insisting that there were 17,000 new voters when there were 34,000. This isn’t just a mistake in numbers, but a serious reflection on just how much Jason Micallef didn’t have a clue what he was doing or was meant to do. Over on the other side of the barbed wire, in the Nationalist Party trenches, the secretary-general was organising a streamlined ‘instant response’ campaign involving hundreds of volunteers and professionals, a campaign which was adapted minute on the minute as the situation evolved. Labour, on the other hand, didn’t so much hit the ground running as hit the ground and break both ankles, leaving it incapacitated for the rest of the race. The party had no campaign strategy to speak of. It had no campaign, full stop. It didn’t even have any newspaper advertisements until late in the day, and its upended containers were draped with images that were clearly designed to fit the dimensions of a billboard. The party didn’t know whether it was coming or going. One minute it was shouting about corruption. The next minute its leadership troika accompanied by the clueless secretary-general, all of them with the demeanour of graveside mourners, were filmed by the media trying to get into a disused rubbish dump to prove that it wasn’t disused, with the secretary-general heard on camera saying: “But isn’t this public property?” And the security official saying: “No, actually it’s not. It’s run by a company called Wasteserv.”\\nWould it even occur to any of the bright bulbs up at Mile End to canvass people who don’t vote Labour for their opinion of what possible leader is most likely to encourage them to vote Labour (or at least not to fight like crazy every five years to ensure that Labour is not elected)? Well, I wouldn’t think so, because the brightest bulbs have all departed and what’s left is Sant’s gang – Joseph Muscat, Jason Micallef, Manwel Cuschieri – and those over whose intellectual capacities I had better draw a discreet veil, like Michael Falzon and Anglu Farrugia. I can’t see any of them sitting down and saying: “I know, why don’t we ask those who don’t vote Labour which potential leader is most likely to attract them to Labour?”\\nSant’s gang aren’t going to ask because they put personal ambition before the interest of the party (Sant stayed on despite losing two general elections and a referendum, and went on to lose another election as a result, and he still has no regrets). As for the rest, the least said about their brainpower, the better.\\nSo they are going to choose Joseph Muscat, and when we tell them that this doesn’t work for us, they tell us that it’s an internal matter and why don’t we go and check out the goings-on at the Nationalist Party instead. Really, it’s no wonder they’ve been on a losing ticket since 1976, and by the time the 2013 general election comes round, Alfred Sant’s election-win-on-the back-of-VAT will be the only electoral majority this mess has been able to win in almost four decades.\\nThe main problem with the Labour Party is that it insists on choosing ‘Labour leader’ material rather than prime ministerial material. If the party wishes the people to choose its leader as prime minister in 2013, it had better make damn sure that he falls within the prime ministerial category – and Joseph Muscat certainly does not. Nor is he the type who can be groomed for the role, as Eddie Fenech Adami and Lawrence Gonzi were. He just doesn’t have the depth or the qualities. He is a follower, not a leader, and what’s worse is that the person he follows is Alfred Sant.\\nDaphne Caruana Galizia writes a column on Thursdays for The Malta Independent.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nL-Imperu ta’ Joe Mizzi\\nThen they wonder why they came across as ridiculous. In the general election campaign, Alfred Sant told a crowd of harridans beneath a tent in Senglea that if the Labour government failed to find oil, Joe Mizzi would have to resign. Joe Mizzi? Oh, yes – the Minister Without Portfolio in Sant’s 1996-1998 cabinet, who was installed at the Auberge de Castille with no purpose in particular.\\nIt turned out that Sant had since earmarked him as the Minister Who Will Find Oil Or Else. ‘Insibu z-zejt,’ he told the shrieking crowd. ‘Ghaliex le?’ Sitting there on my sofa, I privately thought that all the stress had finally caused the man to lose his marbles, and before we knew it, we would have a prime minister who was one sandwich short of a picnic, for want of a better expression.\\nMy geography student son, watching the ‘find oil or resign’ speech on television, asked me whether the leader of the opposition could possibly be insane. I said that I wasn’t going to venture an opinion on that, but there was obviously something not quite right up there if he thought that he was going to win the election by getting Miss Miriam Dalli to put on a Super One loop that video of him telling the Super One cameraman and that toby jug who ‘edits’ Maltastar.com to f**k off. Then he dived into his bedroom and returned with a geological map and a detailed explanation, not a word of which I understood. The gist was that the Opposition leader couldn’t make the discovery of oil an electoral promise, and he certainly couldn’t depend on it to solve the problems he was about to create by promising to subsidise the price of oil as it went through the roof.\\nSo now we don’t have Joe Mizzi installed at Castille, and we’re not going to find oil. This government, sensible chaps, haven’t breathed a word about it, preferring to work towards tangible objectives rather than bake pies in the sky.\\nWondering what became of Joe Mizzi, now that he needn’t spend five years frantically trying to persuade some oil company to explore our waters and come up with the goods, I logged on to www.joemizzi.org. And amazingly, his site remains riddled with references to oil exploration, including a video section called ‘Tiftix ghaz-zejt’, video clips from his ‘oil exploration’ appearances on Bondi’s show, and articles about oil exploration.\\nHere’s one he wrote for The Times 15 months ago, in which he promises to resign if the new Labour government doesn’t find oil. I wonder who wrote it for him.\\n\\nOil realities\\nMy comment in Parliament that I will present my resignation if a new Labour government fails to extract oil shows the Labour Party’s unambiguous and determined commitment to fulfil its promises to the people of this country. Nevertheless, Robert Musumeci’s contribution to The Times, labelled Oil Myths (November 14), and the PN-run media, seem disturbed with such a pledge and the serious approach to local politics. They resort to mocking what they cannot comprehend. The PN’s reaction is understandable in its present dismal circumstances. The words “resignation” and “commitment to fulfil promises” are not only missing from their political vocabulary and are incomprehensible to them but these words are like anathema to their ears.\\nMr Musumeci should not ask whether I am implying that the present PN administration .is deliberately failing to find oil, but why our country remains the only country in the central Mediterranean region that does not extract oil, despite our sizeable maritime territories and very good petroleum plays. This fact stands as a sore thumb in the PN’s failed record in oil exploration.\\nMr Musumeci also asks whether the subject of oil exploration comes in the public domain when an election is nearing. This comment should be directed to Minister Ninu Zammit, who is responsible for oil exploration. The recent announcement on oil exploration activity in blocks 4 and 5 seems to be timed prior to pending elections, and only serves to heighten expectations of wealth, and increase investments in the oil companies, which only boosts oil exploration elsewhere.\\nBlocks 4 and 5 have already been investigated by means of 2D seismic tests, when potential reservoir rocks were identified. However, the blocks lie at considerable distance from the known source rock in the Ragusa basin in Southern Sicily. Texaco carried out a 2D seismic survey in 1991 and claimed that the Ragusa basin source rock extends to blocks 4 and 5, although no well was drilled to confirm this. Their interpretation failed to convince and Texaco could not farm out its claim to a company willing to actually drill a well in the area.\\nInterestingly, two years later, a UNESCO learned publication makes no reference to source rocks or the Ragusa basin extending to this area! Instead, this publication (with the Malta official imprimatur) links the potential reservoir rocks to geological events unrelated to the productive Ragusa basin.\\nA few months ago, the government contracted Global Petroleum to investigate blocks 4 and 5 and the myth of the productive Ragusa basin extending to this area was revived in the hope of raising expectations again. Now that Mr Musumeci seems to have attained expertise on the oil exploration subject, can he perhaps clarify the government’s oil myths and their strong tinge of pre-electoral political opportunism?\\nIn today’s tough economic times, the people of this country want their future founded on realities not myths. The MLP’s commitment to oil exploration speaks for itself. During the short-lived Labour administration (1996-98) we did not procrastinate to drill the Gozo well. In those days the PN’s heavy pre-electoral propaganda was mainly targeted to cover up and neglect the positive results on the extraction of oil in Malta, yet, just a few weeks after the PN returned to power, drilling was not halted immediately but was given the green light to proceed. Today, the MLP is promising that when it is returned to power it will continue from where it was untimely halted.\\n“Today, the MLP is promising that when it is returned to power it will continue from where it was untimely halted.” Famous last words, and ungrammatical ones, too, literally translated from Maltese into English.\\nAt least now we know why Alfred Sant was so determined in his promise to halve the surcharge come what may. Joe Mizzi was going to do a Moses and strike a rock with his divining-stick.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 31st, 2008 at 11:17 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHankering after his roots as Inspector Farrugia, the man who had an international affair with an elephant (the famous photograph was slotted into that section of his website marked International Affairs) won’t let the notorious case of the Xiri ta’ Voti rest.\\nHe told The Sunday Times yesterday that his report to the police on the ‘purchase’ of ‘hundreds’ of votes by ‘the Nationalists’ came up to a full three pages. Amazing. He wouldn’t have been able to fit the names onto that, let alone the results of his forensic examinations. Well, Lorry Pullicino wasn’t known for his exacting standards.\\nSomebody told me that Anglu Farrugia doesn’t have the same university degree as Lawrence Gonzi, as I remarked the other day – because Farrugia graduated magnum cum laude and Gonzi didn’t. What? You can graduate magnum cum laude from the University of Malta when you can’t write, can’t spell, can’t punctuate and can’t speak or write English? My God. No wonder he has ideas beyond his abilities and intelligence.\\nThat aside, Farrugia also told The Sunday Times that he is ‘in contact’ with the European Commission and the OSCE about this little matter. I wonder what they might be thinking. ‘Here’s another email from that Maltese MP who can’t write, can’t spell, can’t punctuate and communicates in pidgin.” “Oh really? What does he want this time?” “I can’t work it out. It’s written in pidgin.”\\nOddly, Farrugia made a point of telling the newspaper that ‘proof of irregularity would give rise to a political issue rather than a legal one.’ In that case, why did he go to the Paraventu, whose job it is to investigate crimes? Perhaps they should charge him with wasting police time.\\nIf he has proof that votes were bought and sold, that is definitely a crime. So if he thinks that he has only a ‘political’ case, whatever that means, then he has no evidence of a crime at all. He went on to explain that there are lots of ways in which votes can be bought (and sold). ‘One way was to promise a vote to a candidate and the voter would then take a picture of the ballot sheet with a mobile phone.’\\nOh come on. There are so many holes in this reasoning that I don’t know where to begin. One, promising to vote for X is not the same as selling your vote to X. Two, people have been voting in return for favours granted or promised since voting began. Three, paying money for a vote is not the same as promising to do something in return for a vote.\\nAnd four, when Farrugia first spoke about the purchase of votes I didn’t think he meant this rubbish. I thought he meant that somebody was actually buying up the voting documents of known Labour supporters so that they wouldn’t be able to vote. But that might be because I’m a practical, commonsensical sort and Farrugia clearly is not. If I was going to set about buying votes, I would buy voting documents to reduce the Labour vote, not give Labour voters the equivalent of a day’s wage in return for the promise that they would vote PN. I would start off from the premise that, by definition, you couldn’t possibly trust somebody like that to keep a promise.\\nThe Pink Panther – sorry, Elephant – also revealed that he has been nagging the government to summon international observers for the general election. This idea probably came to him when he himself was an international observer at some general election somewhere (heaven knows why they wanted him, but anyway – maybe it was a general election to the Parliament of Elephants).\\nI hope he does contest the Labour Party leadership election. He stands no chance of winning and he will provide plenty of much needed comedic value.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nEvarist Bartolo, who spent years writing an ‘anonymous’ column for the Labour newspaper KullHadd, under the pseudonym Maria l-Maws, has told The Malta Independent that his “charisma, intelligence, enthusiasm for making things happen and sense of humour” are what make him stand out as a potential party leader.\\nI’m busy right now trying to think of at least one sensible reason why anyone at all might think it’s a good idea to tell a reporter that he is charismatic, intelligent and humorous. Not one springs to mind.\\nLet me just run that scenario through my mind. Reporter: Why do you think you would make a good Labour Party leader? Maria l-Maws: Oh, I have lots of charisma, I’m intelligent, can make things happen and yes, I have a sense of humour, too.\\nDoes the Labour Party breed arrogance, or does it just attract hopelessly arrogant and self-satisfied individuals?\\nI did agree with Maria l-Maws when he damned that jumped-up twerp with faint praise: ‘I like Joseph and believe in his potential’ – take note, ‘potential’ and not ‘qualities’ – ‘He is doing very well as one of our members of the European Parliament.’ Left unsaid: and that’s precisely where he should stay.\\nMaria l-Maws thinks that he has cross-party appeal, and that he can ‘connect to the people inside the party and beyond’ through his ‘ideas, energy, experience and proven ability.’ Maybe so, but lots of people also think that he’s a bit of a snake in the grass – or should that be a mouse in the wainscot? You never know what that man is thinking, whether he has his own amusing little agenda or whether he’s just along for the ride. He was so unconvincing on that last pre-election episode of Bondiplus, trying to defend the indefensible in Labour’s electoral proposals, such as they were. He looked so shifty and uncomfortable, and then he came out with that amusing little attack on his host. ‘Better be careful, or we’ll know that what they say about you is true,’ he threatened Lou Bondi, in that dreadful snake-in-the-grass way that he has with insinuation. ‘What do they say about me?’ Bondi asked. ‘They call you Gonziplus.’ Oh ha ha ha, tres amusing. If there’s one thing he has in common with his friend Fred, it’s the inability to crack a joke. At least Fred doesn’t think he has a sense of humour or boast about it.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 31st, 2008 at 11:53 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nMaria l-Maws thinks that a party leader must be charismatic. True. But he also needs a good dose of political intelligence, as distinct from the usual kind, and the ability to read people and pick up their messages.\\nYet Maria l-Maws couldn’t even read the writing on the wall in this election. Even without the surveys that said plain and clear that the vast majority of new voters were behind Lawrence Gonzi (while Jason was busy thinking that there were only 17,000 of them rather than 34,000), it was possible to see where the youth vote was going.\\nMaria l-Maws teaches at the university, and still he couldn’t see what was happening. He didn’t even bother to sit and pick a few brains. Oh no. Instead, he waited until the general election had come and gone, and then he convened a bunch of students at his home for a post-mortem inquiry. Gosh, that’s useful. He told Malta Today: “I regret that I did not organise meetings like these before the elections. They would have been such an eye-opener for me and the party. As I spoke to them, I thought to myself, ‘this is what democracy is about.’”\\nDing-dong. Evarist makes the thrilling discovery that speaking to people gives you a pretty good idea of what they want and how they think. But the Labour Party, of course, is a closed book and a closed shop. The only people Labour politicians listen to are those who vote Labour. Every day for the past 18 years I have been telling them what’s wrong with them and will they listen? Will they hell. I don’t support them, so my views are not considered to be of any value. It doesn’t occur to these people that it is precisely because I don’t support them that I know what’s wrong with them and can be trusted to tell them exactly what’s so unattractive and untrustworthy about them.\\nThey’re not going to start listening any time soon, despite their professed intentions. Just listen to Jason shoot his mouth off. Just hark at that twerp with his 15-year project which he claims to have written in 10 days.\\nSo what did the student focus group tell Maria l-Maws? Nothing that I hadn’t already picked up myself during the campaign, without the aid of surveys or polls, but using only commonsense and observation. I may not be charismatic and intelligent, but I have a good pair of eyes in my head and there’s nothing wrong with my hearing. They told him that the message ‘bidu gdid’ was frightening and unnerving because people didn’t want to start all over again; they wanted to carry on as they were, but better. Every single person fighting in the Nationalist trenches picked that up immediately. So how come nobody on the Labour side did? How come nobody shot down that stupid slogan and the even stupider message behind it when Jason and Fred came up with it? Ah – because nobody dares challenge them, that’s why.\\nThe students also told the man known in tal-pepe circles (he has a tal-pepe wife) as Ev that Labour should have better policies that are relevant to the middle classes and not just the working class, and that these policies should be worked out well and presented in a credible fashion. Ding dong again. Need it take a focus group of students to tell Maria l-Maws something so obvious? Couldn’t he have worked it out for himself? He’s been an MP for 16 years, for heaven’s sake.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nEvarist Bartolo launched himself into the leadership fray with some heavy presence in yesterday’s newspapers. Here are some choice quotations from his interview with The Sunday Times.\\n“The fact that Dr Sant stayed on obviously prevented the party from learning all the lessons and moving on. But the way things happened and the kind of people who contested the leadership in 2003….I personally thought he was still the best person”.\\nYou have to see this in the light of the fact that Maria l-Maws was thinking of contesting that leadership election, but when Alfred Sant changed his mind about resigning (what a surprise) he decided not to challenge him. ‘The kind of people who contested the leadership in 2003’ were Anglu Farrugia and John Attard Montalto. Maria l-Maws put himself forward for the deputy leadership but was beaten to it. And now he thinks that the delegates who didn’t choose him as deputy leader are going to choose him as leader. Oh, self-delusion.\\n“I think even if you analyse our last campaign, whether we like it or not I think we give ourselves a very tribal image – that if you don’t form part of this tribe you’re not welcome….it’s as though we put up obstacles to prevent people from joining in.”\\nDamn right. And all they needed was Charles Mangion shouting about DNA and Michael Falzon screeching about the lions of change – that, and all those scary people waving torca flags and frightening the horses.\\n“I think logistically we weren’t as organised as they were. It’s one of the things on which we need to get our act together.”\\nSuper – the first thing you should do is sack Jason Micallef. He hasn’t a clue what a campaign is, and he’s too busy fixing his hair to work out the meaning of strategy. The secretary-general is the be-all and end-all of party organisation, especially in a campaign, and Jason Micallef was a poor shadow of Joe Saliba. Saliba may not have much of a hairstyle, but he knows how to win an election.\\n“There was an almost complete absence from the Internet, which is terrible. I ask my communications students at the university where they get their information from. There was a time when they would say TV, radio, friends and newspapers, in that order. Now the first medium is Internet, then friends, TV, radio and newspapers. If you’re not where they are, someone else is filling that gap. And the Nationalist Party filled it very well.”\\nWell, quite frankly, what did Evarist expect from the party that, in government, has made it its mission to put the entire country on line? Meanwhile, the Labour Party had a leader who still buys his books by hunting for them in shops instead of hitting the Amazon button, and who has never, not once in a single speech or article that I can remember, mentioned information technology. Famously, he doesn’t own even a mobile telephone or a television, though he does have one of those – what do you call them? – computers.\\n“I think there was over-confidence and complacency that we were going to win….that people were so fed up that Labour would win. It wasn’t like that.”\\nSack Jason Micallef. He did it. Ask the book-makers.\\n“If you look at the result, our comfort zone is still the south. But demographically, people are moving to the north. So that presents us with a serious problem because our social base is shrinking. Unless we make all the necessary changes to be present in the north, which means being more present with the aspiring middle class, this party will remain a big party but one for the minority.”\\nThere was a big debate about this on one of the threads on this blog. I said pretty much the same thing that Maria l-Maws did here, but I also added something else: that the quickest way for the Labour Party to fast-forward itself to success at the polls is by getting itself a middle class leader instead of yet another working class one or worse, a working class boy made good in a suit and decorated with Harvard certificates and DBAs from God knows where. The so-called middle classes (the real thing not the aspirationals) can sniff out a fraud at 50 paces. Middle class people don’t trust working classes leaders, no matter how they’re dressed up to look like something else, end of story.\\n“If the person who takes the leadership does not realise that it’s not a question of recovering a few thousand votes but also a question of making Labour the party of the upwardly-mobile, with which big parts of the middle class feel comfortable, then Labour is doomed to remain a tribal minority – closed in on itself, geared rather towards not losing ground than to gaining ground.”\\nYes, I agree with Maria l-Maws there. He’s right. But then, he teaches communications, so why wasn’t he picking up on all this before and ramming it down Jason Micallef’s silly little throat?\\n“I think that just as Alfred Sant and Charles Mangion did, the other deputy leader should resign. This also means he should not be running for the leadership post. Even the party president and the secretary-general should step down. During the campaign, it was obvious that there were five people who were in charge of what was going on – the president, the three leaders and the secretary-general.”\\nYes, but they were there for the glory, running about from Kennedy Grove to Buskett to Maghtab dump dressed like black crows and with the demeanour of graveside mourners. They thought they were going to win, and they wanted to make damn sure that the entire country knew from their television screens who the persons responsible for victory really were. Now that they are responsible for the loss, they’re not quite sure how to behave. One has Irrevocably Resigned and plans to live on through his Poodle. Mangion says he will resign but is acting as leader for now. Michael Falzon is – unbelievably – asking delegates to make him party leader when he was a miserable failure even as deputy leader. Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi has removed his nun-in-civvies persona from the public domain until it is safe to come out to play again. And as for Jason Micallef – sigh.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 31st, 2008 at 3:26 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nHere’s a little something from the man who fancies himself prime minister:\\nThe Chinese campaign on Tibet has taken an interesting development. The Chinese are now adopting a media campaign to neutralise another media campaign. In blogs, chat-rooms, bulletin boards and by SMS, Chinese citizens are assaulting the international press, exposing mistakes and depicting what they perceive as foreign manipulation.\\nOne hopes that the matter will not lie to rest once the Olympic Games are over.\\n– Joseph Muscat, The Times (last Monday, 31 March)\\nI’m sure he didn’t mean it quite that way, in which case his thinking and language skills need some work. Or maybe he did mean it that way, because I don’t think I’m imagining things when I pick up more than a hint of admiration in his description of the way “the Chinese” (what, in general?) have “adopted a media campaign to neutralise another media campaign”. He seems wide-eyed in wonder at the smart way they are “assaulting the international press”, picking on errors and revealing “manipulation”. Please don’t tell me that Reno Calleja of the China-Malta Friendship Society, once known as Il-Kolonna tal-Partit Laburista, is another of this\\nsilly man’s mentors.\\nAnd then Muscat says he “hopes that the matter will not lie to rest (sic) once the Olympic Games are over”. I’m trying to work out which side the self-satisfied future prime minister of Malta is on in this moral battle: China or Tibet? Because it certainly doesn’t seem from this piece of writing that he’s with the people of Tibet on this one.\\nPerhaps he admires “the Chinese” in their assault on foreign interference in blogs and Internet chat-rooms because he wishes the Labour Party had had the presence of mind to do the same in this last general election. Yes, I’d wondered about that myself – though of course, it’s useful to have some arguments to hand when you’re assaulting people in cyberspace, and all the Labour exponents seemed to have was paranoia and hysteria.\\nOne of the more prominent members of the party, Maria l-Maws who has put himself forward for the leadership, has taught communications at the university for years. He teaches communications at undergraduate level, and yet he had no input into his party’s communication with the public. Is it because he wasn’t wanted? Maybe – but from interviews he has been giving to the press, I gather it’s more likely because he couldn’t understand what was required. Perhaps he should have asked some students\\nbefore the event rather than afterwards.\\nThe newspaper articles Evarist Bartolo wrote before the election were full of confidence that Labour would win because the people he met on his house-calls were so fed-up. That’s what they told him, and he believed them. He made the mental leap from their irritation with the government to their vote for Alfred Sant, with whom they were probably even more irritated but too polite to say so. That Harry Vassallo made exactly the same mistake. On the basis of what people told him on house visits, he thought he would get four seats in parliament. Oh dear.\\nOnly now is Maria l-Maws saying what should have been done to communicate with people. Well, it’s a tad too late for that – water under the bridge, as the Irrevocably Resigned leader likes to say.\\nMeanwhile, the smug-as-a-bug-in-a-rug future prime minister of Malta is busy admiring “the Chinese” for their internet assault on those who support the people of Tibet. Typical.\\n“One hopes that the matter will not lie to rest (sic) once the Olympic Games are over.” What does he mean? That “the Chinese” will continue to invade internet chat-rooms and blogs and take their oppression of Tibet into cyberspace? And what do the Olympic Games have to do with Tibet? The matter was being discussed before and it will continue to be discussed afterwards.\\n\\nChinese soldiers shooting Tibetan pilgrims, Mount Everest, October 2006\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nI have to say that Maltese political life is charmingly littered with individuals whom I can most tactfully describe as interestingly different. And the more ‘different’ they are, the more inclined they appear to be to expose their eccentricities on their websites.\\nTake this eulogy that Emmy Bezzina wrote about himself on www.emmybezzina.org, for instance.\\nI’d forgotten that he had joined the Moonies. When I was growing up, all the parents were in a panic about them. You’d hear whispers in various kitchens: ‘Madonna, it-tifel ta’ X mar mal-Moonies. X’wahda din!’ And there would be dire parental warnings about brainwashing and strange Moonie sects. I thought it was all quite amusing, given that I had spent my life that far being brainwashed in a convent by nuns and had shown myself fully resistant to the effects. But now here’s our Emmy, becoming a\\nrebellious youth so late in life and following in the wake of the Reverend Moon (who he calls ‘Father Moon’ as though he is someone who regularly says Mass down at St Patrick’s). Perhaps they’ll marry him off to some Vietnamese chick at one of those mass weddings they enjoy so much, and we’ll be left in peace.\\nDo bother reading all the way through to the end, and you’ll discover that Emmy tal-Moonies has written the biography of the Reverend Moon. That should be the bestseller of the year.\\nEMMY BEZZINA, as Dr Emmanuel is popularly known in his native country MALTA , is an intellectual revolutionary who has fought hard over a number of years to bring out of its intellectual insularity his native country, the small Mediterranean island of the Republic of Malta.\\nBorn in what is termed as a Middle Class background, a few years after World War II came to an end, Emmy `s mother JOAN was a dominantly – quiet woman, dedicated hundred per cent to the Family where literally the home was the traditional castle. Dr Bezzina is in fact the eldest of six siblings, five boys and a girl, the latter being a twin, all of which are still alive and all over fifty years of age.\\nEmmy`s father , Joseph Bezzina, was a very enterprising man who, coming from a business background, became a successful businessman himself. His hallmark was work, work and work intermingled with relaxation while still working. He died on January 31st, 2004, three years ago, aged 79 years. Emmy `s mother is still alive aged presently 85 years.\\nDr Bezzina received his elementary, preliminary and secondary education in Catholic-run schools and colleges, particularly an eight-year period in a then highly-disciplined, Jesuit-administered College. At St. Aloysius` College, Dr Bezzina distinguished himself in personality, oratory and public-speaking. He was the Principal Actor playing the leading roles, among others, in the musicals The King & I as well as The Sound of Music. At College, Dr Bezzina won many prizes, the most coveted one being that of Best Aloysian for the whole eight – year scholastic period spent at college .\\nMeanwhile, Dr Bezzina had involved himself in a number of Organizations which helped him to appreciate the nobility of being of service to others. Eventually this training helped him to fit in like a glove with the Unificationists laudable objective instilled by Reverend Fr. Syung Myung Moon of living for the sake of others.\\nThen begun Dr Bezzina`s tertiary education where he obtained a Diploma in Effective English and Personal Efficiency in 1968 from The Regent Institute – London. In 1969, from The Royal University of MALTA, he graduated Bachelor of Arts. A short course in Social Sciences followed at Edinburgh University – Scotland preceded by a short course in the French language at Dijon University – France.\\nMeanwhile, Dr Bezzina because of his public-speaking prowess became involved with the Media, particularly in the field of broadcasting where in 1963 he had won a prize in a Civil Defence Course which entitled him to broadcast his own Essay. From 1963, Dr Bezzina remained involved to date with broadcasting programmes, in both production and presentation levels. Indeed over these years, Dr Bezzina`s name in Maltese broadcasting, radio and television, has become a byword .\\nDr Bezzina is a Salzburg Alumnus. He was sent by the United States Information Service [USIS], as it was known in 1976, to Salzburg to attend a participatory Mass Media Course. The Course took place in Salzburg ( Mozart`s City ) in March 1976 ( at that time Italian ALDO MORO had been kidnapped and subsequently murdered by the Brigate Rosse ) at the idyllic Schloss Leopoldskron ( where substantial parts of The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews had been filmed ). At the end of the short course, as an\\nimportant incidental reference, every participating student is added to the List of Salzburg Alumni.\\nIn November 1976, Dr Bezzina obtained the Diploma as a Notary Public , now from the University of Malta. A year later, he graduated as Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). Hence 2007 marks the thirtieth year since Dr Bezzina begun his private practice as a litigious lawyer and also as a Law Consultant. His Doctoral Thesis then was on a socially-burning theme by the name of : Broadcasting Legislation – A Comparative Study.\\nIn January 1978 , Dr Bezzina set up his own Law Office which over the years became Bezzina Law Services of which he is the Principal. In December 1979, Dr Bezzina married and he now has five children.\\nIn 1980, Dr Bezzina obtained the Diploma in Sacred Theology from the Faculty of Theology in association with the Vatican. In later years, he obtained a Certificate in General Thinking Skills under the guidance of world – renowned creative / lateral / parallel Thinker, Professor Edward de Bono. Then, Dr Bezzina obtained a further Diploma in Canon Law relating to Marriage Procedure – Jurisdiction and Jurisprudence. This from the Maltese Catholic Curia.\\nIn the eighties, Dr Bezzina departed from the acting roles in the theatre and radio & television broadcasting to concentrate on a then revolutionary concept in Maltese broadcasting, namely tackling very controversial and intimate issues. Though he produced many such programmes, hardly anyone was broadcast not to leave some sort of controversy in its wake – hence why Dr Bezzina became known as the revolutionary, controversial, broadcaster. Many were those who literally wanted his head off !\\nThe eighties were a very dynamic period in the life of Dr Bezzina ranging from his private to his social and professional life. At this time, Dr Bezzina became involved in politics contesting the General Elections in 1987 and 1992. He pioneered live discussion programmes on hot issues, very often ending heavily arguing with some of his listeners in direct phone calls on air ! This made him loved by many and shunned by others, but Dr Bezzina knew all along that the silent majority were firmly behind him, though not yet ready to come forth in the open.\\nIn his professional life, as a litigious practising lawyer, Dr Bezzina has particularly made a name for himself as a Family Lawyer, Constitutional Law lawyer with particular emphasis on Human Rights, the incidental Civil and Criminal lawsuits that emanate there from , and now since Malta became a full Member of the European Union in April 2004, European Union Law & Regulations.\\nPolitically, currently, [until he discovers fresh talents, presumably] Dr Bezzina describes himself as a liberal-reformist democrat and indeed in the run up to the European Parliament Maltese Elections in 2004, Dr Bezzina founded the ALPHA Liberal Democratic Reformist Political Party of which he is now Chairman / Founder. ALPHA contested the European Parliament Maltese Elections in 2004 ; the Valletta Local Council Elections in 2005 ; and is planning to contest the Maltese General Elections possibly in 2007.\\nDr Bezzina is also very interested in Non Governmental Organizations Legislation [ NGOs ] that is still non-enacted in Malta. He is indeed Chairman of a NGO, namely the Family Rights` Association – Malta.\\nDr Bezzina is the author of many articles on socio-legal issues, some of which are reproduced in his website on www.emmybezzina.org. He regularly participates in Public Forums and is currently presenting and producing on a Maltese Private tv Station COURT Tv, a series of educational programmes about laws and Court legal Procedures.\\nDr Bezzina became acquainted with Fr Moon `s Movement in the late nineties through the Malta Centre at Valletta. He has participated in numerous Conferences, Convocations, Seminars and Study Groups related to the Movement`s overall objectives. He was present at the inauguration of the Inter Religious and International Peace Council [ IIPC ] both in the USA as well as in Europe; at the inauguration of the Universal Peace Federation [ UPF ] both in Seoul – South Korea, as well as in Europe; at the investiture ceremonies of the Crowning of the King and Queen of Peace in South Korea and in Europe; participated actively in the formal visit of Mother Moon to Malta as part of her tour to several countries to spread Fr. Moon`s World Peace Message; was a VIP Guest at the inauguration of the Peace Kingdom Palace in 2006; and was an invited guest at Reverend Moon`s official birthday celebrations since True Parent`s 80th birthday in 2000.\\nThese very intimate experiences with the Movement has made Dr Bezzina practise earnestly the noble principle of living for the sake of others. Dr Bezzina was one of the early Ambassadors for Peace to be appointed in Istanbul in 2001 – he is now a Senior, International Ambassador for Peace and the UPF – Malta`s representative of the local Ambassadors. Dr Bezzina sat on the Invitational International Council to organize Reverend Moon and Mother Moon`s respective international Peace Tours.\\nDr Bezzina produced and presented a one and a half television programme about the Movement in Malta , as well as a three-hour radio programme. Both programmes were live and with phone-ins. They were a big breakthrough in Malta considering the tremendous influence in the Media by the Catholic Church.\\nDr Bezzina has been assigned impromptu to deliver speeches at Conferences organized by the Movement at which he participates. He took part in two Middle East Peace Pilgrimages to promote PEACE in the Middle East. Thousands of Ambassadors for Peace have taken part in such MEP Pilgrimages which have been a huge success, despite the obvious risks and inconveniences: all for a most worthy cause.\\nDr Bezzina has now contributed a study about Father Moon on the occasion of his eighty-seventh birthday celebrations. This biography has indeed been written also in association with this memorable celebration.\\nSigned,\\nDr Emmanuel D. BEZZINA.\\nSenior Ambassador for Peace.\\n  \\n\\n\\nAhna se nissiehbu mas-setta ta’ Joseph Muscat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 2nd, 2008 at 9:38 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nEmmy Bezzina is detrimental to the credibility of the pro-divorce lobby. Because he has set up something called the Malta Divorce Movement, of which he remains the chairman, nobody else wants to be associated with that movement. When anyone credible speaks in favour of divorce, they must first make a point of saying that they have nothing to do with Bezzina. This is complicating matters.\\nWhen the international media alights on the fact that Malta and the Philippines are the only two countries in the world without divorce, as they do from time to time, they look up their contacts list and head straight for the Malta Divorce Movement and Emmy Bezzina. A year or two ago, I had a telephone call from BBC World, who were putting together yet another radio show about the fact that Malta has no divorce. The journalist who rang told me that she had spoken to Bezzina. “For heaven’s sake,” I said. “He has no credibility at all. He’s the equivalent of a circus act. You can’t possibly quote him. He’s actually outside the debate\\nbecause he can’t be taken seriously.”\\nNow here’s more about Emmy by Emmy, from www.emmybezzina.org.\\n\\nMeeting Emmy Bezzina …. Dealing with values\\nEMMY BEZZINA, as he is popularly known, has written numerous specialized articles particularly related to Family Law. He is the CHAIRMAN of the MALTA DIVORCE MOVEMENT and the Founder and Chairman of the FAMILY RIGHTS’ ASSOCIATION, two Organizations that compliment one another.\\nDr BEZZINA is equally planning to publish a book DIVINE THOUGHTS in 2004. In recent years, Dr BEZZINA has become very active with the Reverend Dr MOON’s Organization, the Unification Movement. He was indeed also made an AMBASSADOR OF PEACE in 2001, the United Nations’ Year dedication to Non-Government Organizations. Recently, he was one of the co-founders of\\nthe Interreligious and International PEACE COUNCIL in NEW YORK, between October 1 – 4, 2003, 11PC, marching with about 12,000 people next to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Friday, October 3, 2003.\\nHe also attended the celebrations of Rev. MOON’s 80 Birthday in SEOUL – South Korea, between JULY 10-14, 2003, where he was very active during discussions featuring also in the magazine produced by the Movement.\\nDr Emmy D. BEZZINA LL.D., had taken an active role in True Families as the Foundation for World Peace in the New Millennium, Third International Seminar, OCTOBER 10-14, 1999 in WASHINGTON, DC, where the Interreligious and International Federation for World Peace was founded. He was also founder-member of the Organization’s WORLD MEDIA ASSOCIATION.\\nDr BEZZINA is a fearless fighter for the Truth & Justice, outspoken on social injustices and a Flag Bearer for the Fundamental Human and Family Rights & Freedoms. He is frequently invited to give talks on radio and tv and in Forums and Conferences, particularly on topics that related to social, serious issues like AIDS and World Peace. He is a fervid believer in Rev. Moon’s vision of MAN being intimately connected to COSMIC ENERGY and that without such synchronization MAN’s mission as a Divine Entity\\nwould not be correctly fulfilled.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 2nd, 2008 at 9:45 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe one at Frangul Hall sounds like it was a lot of fun: kollu spettaklu, kant, briju (and probably also brija, given that amount of hair gel), ikel u xorb.

Tsvangirai campaigned under the slogan ‘For a new beginning’. In his case, it had resonance with the electorate, given that they are fighting against the oppression of Robert Mugabe, unbelievable inflation, hunger, no income, the negation of the most basic human rights, and death and torture squads. Trust Alfred Sant, with his fond belief that you can create reality through the dogged deployment of language, to think that the same slogan would resonate with the electorate here in Malta, with its cushy life that some people define as hardship (try getting your home repossessed in the US and living out of your car with the kids and the dog).\\nIt can’t have been Jason Micallef who picked that slogan off the international news, because he comes across as the sort who doesn’t even know where/what Zimbabwe is. Zimbabwe? Is that a new kind of hair gel?\\nAnd it can’t have been Joseph Muscat, either, because he’s the sort who would probably side with Mugabe, giving his strange comment in The Times last Monday about the Chinese and Tibet.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 2nd, 2008 at 11:23 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nI would never go to Saudi Arabia and shout that the ruling sheikhs go with whores and that Mohammed wasn’t a true prophet but a self-publicist whose campaigns were funded by his astute wife’s market-dealings. I would show that kind of reserve only out of respect for the political and religious sentiments of the people who might overhear, but mainly because I wouldn’t want to end up in the hands of the police, being prosecuted in some shariah court.\\nIf we look askance at Islamic and totalitarian states for that kind of behaviour, then we should also be looking askance at ourselves when we read something like this story in today’s newspaper.\\nThe Times, Wednesday, 2 April 2008\\nCharged with insulting PM, Cabinet and religion\\nA Libyan national was yesterday charged with threatening five police officers and insulting the government and vilifying the Roman Catholic religion when he was escorted to the Ħamrun police station on Monday.\\nMagistrate Jacqueline Padovani heard Rashad Mabruk, 34, who resides in Valletta plead not guilty to threatening the police officers, making false accusations against the police and disregarding their orders between 7 and 9 p.m. in Ħamrun. Mr Mabruk also pleaded not guilty to insulting the government and the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the police and vilifying the Roman Catholic religion by claiming the host is nothing more than a biscuit.\\nHe was granted bail against a personal guarantee of €4,658 (Lm2,000).\\nI know that insulting the president is against the law (and for goodness’ sake, it shouldn’t be), but insulting the government? When did that become a crime? We insult the government all the time, and we damn it, too – haqq il-gvern is practically a registered expletive. The Labour Party has spent the last 20 years insulting the government. The government is insulted by newspaper columnists every day of the week, and by Super One almost every minute. It’s a free country. We’re free to insult the government. Maybe if we were living in China, which Joseph Muscat so admires, things might be a little different. But Chinese laws have no place in Malta.\\nAnd as for insulting the Roman Catholic religion – oh, please. What would we say if we were arrested in Iran for insulting Islam? We would say that they were backward savages who haven’t a clue what democracy and freedom of speech are. And we would be right. Well, with this kind of legislation, the same applies to Malta. It’s just not consonant with the 21st century.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nPeople are cheering because Alfred Grixti has crawled out of the woodwork to challenge Jason for the post of secretary-general.

What are these people trying to do? Turn the Labour Party into an act suitable for Moira Orfei’s circus?

This is not because I think that any one of them presents a real and viable threat to the Nationalist Party, but rather the opposite. I’m worried because they don’t. I’m worried because their quality is so poor that come 2013 we will be back where we have been for the last 40 years – allahares jitla l-Lejber.\\nThe Labour Party thinks that the only reason ‘we’ – we being the 140,000-odd people on the other side of the barbed wire – are giving them advice and offering our opinions is because we want to see them dig themselves deeper into the quagmire. They can’t seem to understand that apart from the Nationalist Party hardcore – they have a hardcore too, though it’s smaller than Labour’s hardcore because on the whole PN voters tend to be more intelligent – thousands of those who vote for the Nationalists would like to see a Labour Party they are comfortable with, one that they might even vote for.\\nLabour supporters are desperate to see ‘their’ party in power, but here’s the thing. They are not terrified of a Nationalist government. They do not think that a Nationalist government is predictable in its unpredictability. They are not going to spend the next five years afraid to turn on the evening news in case they hear something wild and crazy. They know that a Nationalist government will not wake up one morning and do something like remove VAT and spend the next 10 months trying to invent a mad new tax to replace it with. They can grasp the fact that Lawrence Gonzi (and Eddie Fenech Adami) would never step up on a public podium and announce that the man he has named Oil Minister (in a country without an oil industry) will not be forced to find oil and obliged to resign if doesn’t. They can also understand, at some intuitive level, that there is something wrong with people who think and behave like this, but out of loyalty, they never give voice to their concerns.\\nNationalist supporters, on the other hand, live in fear of a Labour government – not because it isn’t ‘their’ government (Nationalist supporters, as I said, tend to be more intelligent and less tribal) but because of what that government means in terms of inept amateurishness.\\nWho are the named contenders for the Labour Party leadership so far? Here’s the shocking list of three: Joseph Muscat, who did nothing but smirk and tell us about the people who have a ‘grazzja mieghu’ when interviewed by Lou Bondi, Michael Falzon, who comes across very well on a one-to-one basis but who performs like somebody ta’ wara l-muntanji in public and who was part of the catastrophic leadership in this last election, and Evarist Bartolo, a specialist in communications who had no idea how the Labour Party was coming across in the campaign and whose alter ego very different to his public face. Now here’s the even more disturbing list of those who are thinking about it: Anglu Farrugia – no need for me to go into any great detail there as I’ve done so several times already, andToni Abela, who behaves on television like somebody auditioning for Moira Orfei’s circus. George Abela? They might have frightened him out of the race already.\\nThe confused thinking over at Labour is quite beyond belief (or perhaps not). They’re telling us – ‘us’ being those of us on the other side of the barbed wire, remember – that we don’t want that smug Cheshire Cat because he’s a threat to Gonzi. Yes, and I’m a threat to Carla Bruni. When we insist that the only possible choice is George Abela, because he is a real threat to Gonzi in that they are remarkably similar, they turn their argument on its head and say that we want Abela because he’ll split the party.\\nWhat? If there’s anyone who’s going to split the party it’s Joseph Muscat. I can already sniff out the fact that the party is splitting between those li ghandhom grazzja mieghu (as he puts it) and those who think that he’s tad-daqqiet ta’ harta, as I do. My visceral response to him has little or nothing to do with party politics. It’s at a human level, and so I have no doubt that lots of Labour people respond to him in the same way. Let me put it this way: if the daughter I don’t have came home and announced of somebody like Muscat that this was the man she planned to marry, I would be devastated with worry. There’s something there that I just can’t put my finger on, but I know it’s there all the same. Whether the party delegates can be bullied or persuaded into voting for somebody so very off-putting is another matter.\\n\\nThe first thing Labour has to ditch is its paranoia. Every time Labour exponents appear on television as guests on one show or another, they are hostile and bristling with antagonism. This was the case before the election, let alone afterwards. I’m not going to run through the list here. I’ll just mention the most recent incident that I watched on television: Frans Ghirxi, who edits L-orizzont, on Bondiplus last Monday. He’s was very pleased with himself because his newspaper has the largest circulation in Malta (other than its sister It-Torca, that is). That means nothing: it’s because Labour supporters are on average less comfortable reading English and less uncomfortable reading rabidly partisan ‘news’ than better-educated Nationalist supporters, who are happier reading the English-language newspapers, which is also why sales of In-Nazzjon and Il-Mument are lower than those of the GWU newspapers.\\nNow Frans is a decent chap, so I can’t understand why he turns into an anger machine when he’s supposed to be having a civilised discussion in front of an audience of many thousands. He fails to give a good account of himself, which is a shame.\\nHis opening gambit was an attack on his host for choosing to discuss the Labour leadership election rather than the prime minister’s choice of cabinet. Well, I’m doing the same here, and I’ll tell Frans why that is: it’s more interesting. For the last 18 years or so, I’ve worked on the basis that if I find something interesting, my readers do too. If I find it yawn-making, so will my readers. I’m pretty average in that respect, not highbrow or different at all, and I use it to my readers’ advantage. A discussion about the prime minister’s choice of ministers leaves me wanting to reach for the remote control to see what’s exciting on the French Hunting and Fishing channel. This is largely because the discussion is about such dull characters, which is why they are safe. The discussion about the Labour leadership, on the other hand, is peopled by characters of assorted quirks and oddity, which is why they are widely regarded as unsafe.\\nAt one point, Bondi quoted at Ghirxi something I had written: that Labour inevitably fails because it chooses ‘Labour leader’ material rather than ‘prime minister’ material – hence Mintoff, Mifsud Bonnici, Sant and now, Muscat. When Sant, for a very brief moment there in 1996, looked like prime minister material (through the rose-tinted spectacles of those drugged on the promise of VAT-removal), he won. When he ceased to look like prime minister material a few months later, people rushed to vote him out.\\nBondi asked Ghirxi what he thought about this. Ghirxi’s response wasn’t like that of Jason Micallef when Bondi confronted him with something I’d written. He didn’t say that he can’t take me seriously because I’d had more bodywork than Cher, but it was in a similar vein. “Allahares il-Partit Laburista kellu jiehu bis-serjeta dak li tghid Daphne,” he said. I suppose it was on the tip of Bondi’s tongue to say that the Labour Party could do a whole lot worse than take my advice on how to win an election, but in the face of such tunnel-vision, you just have to give up. I have no interest in ensuring that the Labour Party remains a mess, but rather the opposite. I can see clearly where they are going wrong, what they have to do to attract the votes of people who think like me (the maxim that you have to set a thief to catch a thief holds true in every sector), and I can’t resist pointing out what the solution is. But what does the losing Labour Party do? It listens only to those who already vote for it. Over the last 40 years, it has developed a bunker mentality and it seems that nothing is going to change that any time soon.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis comic strip came out of the American ‘Intelligent Design’ debate, in which the existence of dinosaurs is questioned by those who take the Old Testament literally. They are insisting that children in schools are taught ‘the two sides of the argument’ – the Intelligent Design side which doesn’t believe in evolution, and the ‘dinosaur’ side, which does.\\nIt has relevance to our own ‘the host is not a biscuit’ society.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, April 5th, 2008 at 3:19 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nI want to be leader of the Opposition\\nParliament will be convened as soon as the by-elections are over and done with, which means way before the Labour Party elects Alfred Sant’s lapdog as its leader on 5 June.\\nSo who will be the leader of the Opposition? Ah, that’s up to Edward Fenech Adami, president of Malta. The leader of the Opposition is not automatically the leader of the Labour Party – oh dear, Freudian slip there; I mean that he is not automatically the leader of the party whose MPs take up most of the space on the Opposition benches.\\nFor a start, you can be leader of a political party without having a seat in parliament, as Harry Vassallo knows only too well. But you cannot be leader of the Opposition without a seat in parliament, because the term ‘Opposition’ has no relevance outside the parliamentary context. This means that when the Poodle is elected on 5 June, he will not immediately assume the role of leader of the Opposition. He will have to wait until some sucker MP has his arm twisted into resigning his seat, unless the Poodle’s master is going to be a man and not a chicken and do the necessary himself.\\nWhat’s going to happen during the Interregnum, then? I am all agog to find out. The Constitution dictates that the leader of the Opposition, like the prime minister, is chosen by the president. Nowadays, this has become a mere formality, because they are the leaders of the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party, either one way or the other. But when parliament is convened, the Labour Party will be without a leader, so who is the president going to choose?\\nThere are those who are saying that though Sant has Irrevocably Resigned from the leadership, he hasn’t also resigned as leader of the Opposition, because that must be done formally in writing to the president. Well, I stand to be corrected, but that sounds like rubbish. Sant ceased to be leader of the Opposition when parliament was dissolved and the election campaign began. We haven’t had an Opposition for around two months, and when parliament is convened, it will not be Sant again because his constitutional status is now just that of an ordinary MP.\\nYou can argue that we haven’t had a proper Opposition since 1987 (or 1996-1998) and you would be right. But the Opposition, if only on paper, requires a leader. The Constitution demands that. So now let’s see what happens.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, April 5th, 2008 at 7:37 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf you missed the spectacle of Joseph Muscat being interviewed by Lou\\nBondi last Monday, here’s the clip.\\n\\nAnd if you missed Brian Hansford talking to Miriam Spiteri Debono, who was Speaker of the House when Alfred Sant was prime minister, here’s the clip.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis is excerpted from an article by Alfred Mifsud, published in The Malta Independent yesterday. It is about the Labour Party leadership election, and the question of whether loyalty to the leader should take precedence over loyalty to the party.\\n“I find it illogical that some contestants are sporting proclaimed loyalty as a worthy qualification for the post. Firstly, it should be established to whom loyalty is due. Should one be loyal to the organisation or to its leader? It is true that often this is one and the same thing. But this is not always the case. Certainly, it was not the case in Labour’s fold following Alfred Sant’s re-election as leader in 2003. It was clear that Alfred Sant over-used his power of incumbency to get himself re-elected by excluding more promising contestants. To name but a few, I can vouch that George Abela and Evarist Bartolo, among others, would have contested if the post was not being reclaimed by Sant with the unfair advantage of his incumbency. I had to take a decision. I was forced to choose between being loyal to the leader and disloyal to Labour or being loyal to Labour and disloyal to the leader who himself was being disloyal to the organisation which he was supposed to lead by example.\\n………In loyalty to the organisation, I refused to be muzzled, and continued on my quest to avoid Labour’s third consecutive crash. How can anyone who accepted to be muzzled consider themselves as being endowed with the attribute of loyalty, when in fact their submissiveness and silence is more typical of disloyalty by putting their personal political career before the party’s interest? Is it not funny how many contestants are now professing their internal disagreement with Sant, and are distancing themselves from responsibility for Labour’s third defeat by claiming they were not allowed to voice their opinions and were not informed of what was actually happening, and who was taking real decisions on the campaign strategy? By so doing, they are all showing their lack of leadership attributes. Leadership means leading, not just following.\\n……Labour delegates have a grave responsibility to consider this matter seriously, so that they choose true leaders and not lesser mortals at the helm of the party. Ultimately, whoever is elected will stand or fall by the choice of the wider electorate – who certainly can distinguish between true leaders and mere followers who have difficulty in distinguishing between abilities of coordination and qualities of leadership.”\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn 1999, some young adults went public with the information that they had been physically and psychologically abused as children in an institution run by nuns in Gozo.\\nI never doubted for a moment that what they said was the truth. The devil is in the detail, and there are some details that just ring true. You have to be a smart liar indeed to come up with descriptions of how you were made to eat your own vomit after being force-fed and throwing up, or how you had your hand ironed with a clothes-iron, of how you were dragged by your hair along the institution corridors. And what would be the point of inventing stories like this in adulthood, in any case, in a country with absolutely no compensation culture for victims and no justice wrought on priests and nuns who abuse children?\\nApart from the fact that the detail of their claims sounded authentic, there was another reason why I didn’t doubt for a minute that they were speaking from experience. I spent the first 13 years of my life at a convent school run by nuns, and so I do not automatically assume that they are meek and holy or even nice, nor do I have any respect for them which is not earned. My reaction to a wimple and habit is not: “Oh, she must be a good person,” but “Brrrrrr! Prove to me that you’re not a nasty piece of work and I might believe you.”\\nGood nuns are like anyone else – ordinary women with their own particular kindnesses and failings. There were no saintly or especially kind and nice nuns at my school. There were just ordinary women in a wimple and habit. Some of them were so ordinary that they couldn’t take the routine and restrictions any more and ditched them for civilian life. Ah, but nasty nuns belong in a special category of their own when it comes to viciousness, spite and vindictiveness. There is a reason for this. It isn’t because nuns in general are nasty (of course not) or because nasty women are attracted to convent life (again, of course not). It’s because that particular way of life fosters a sense of peace in the rare few, but a build-up of anger, resentment and frustration in others.\\nNuns’ vocations have dwindled to almost nothing nowadays. It’s not because of a decline in religious belief or even because the nun’s way of life is now deemed to be irrelevant, given that you can perform charity or pro bono work without taking vows of poverty, chastity or obedience. No, it’s because in the contemporary world, plain women with no particular skills or talents can make a life for themselves regardless. They can earn money, travel, get around, buy flats, cars and nice clothes, do themselves up and go on dates, teach children if they want to without taking vows, and so on and so forth. They might even meet a man and start a family, because that no longer depends on marriage, marriage itself no longer depends on the same factors that it did 40 years ago.\\nBut back then in the dark ages – and boy, do they seem like the dark ages from the perspective of anyone growing up today – a plain woman with no suitors and no hope of ever earning enough money to set up her own home, even if she could find a job in the first place, which was difficult, faced the wonderful prospect of becoming a live-in unpaid slave to her aged parents until the end of their days, following which she would end up a lonely spinster living off some miserable pension. In this scenario, some women would convince themselves, or allow themselves to be convinced, that they had a vocation. Religious orders would even groom the unattractive girls who sucked up to the nuns for attention and who curried favour by developing a passion for Christ and religion. Most of these crushes evaporated into nothing once the girls in question developed their first passion for a real, live, actual boy, leaving the nuns disappointed. Others, perhaps because they were too weak, couldn’t get away. Once inside the order, they succumbed to the pressure and didn’t have the guts to break away and leave, or they had no life to go to as an ex-nun. The boiling resentment would be taken out on the children in their care, or on fellow nuns.\\nThis is not a generalisation, but a depiction of a scenario that made certain nuns what they were. I am overwhelmed by admiration and respect for the hardworking, decent nuns whom I have met in the course of my life, looking after children, old people, refugees and victims of domestic violence. I do wonder why they felt they had to become nuns to do what they do, but that is beside the point. The point is that life in a strict religious order, for those who would have preferred another kind of life altogether but couldn’t get it, was a recipe for disaster, causing a build-up of simmering rage and hatred that spilled out on those who were most readily available and immediately vulnerable. The spectacularly vicious nun is not a cliché of myth and legend, but she was very much a reality. It is only because today’s nuns are the result of true vocations that we don’t get so much of this kind of thing anymore.\\nIn 1999, when those young adults spoke, they were pooh-poohed by many and accused of having a hidden or dubious agenda. The then bishop of Gozo, Nikol Cauchi, set up a commission to study the claims, and some time later it was announced with great fanfare that those claims were unfounded. I remember feeling very angry for the individuals who had somehow found the moral courage, perhaps as a way of coming to terms with what had happened to them, to speak out in public and accuse their abusers even after so many years.\\nStrangely, the fact that they waited so long seems to have worked against their credibility where some observers were concerned. How little these people understand human psychology, and how ill they remember the past, even the fairly recent past. Speaking freely about the abuse you were subjected to as a child is something that you can do only as an adult, when you have reached a point of equilibrium and adjustment. It is in fact the process of adjustment that gives you the motivation you need to get things off your chest. And as an adult, you are more secure and believe – wrongly, as we have seen – that you are more likely to be taken seriously. Also, it is only in the last few years that we have begun to discuss these matters openly, though it is debatable just how openly given the church’s need to pass a cloak of darkness over everything, while people protest in the newspapers. When I first starting working, we were not allowed to use the word ‘rape’. Actual rape had to be referred to as carnal knowledge. Rape as a metaphor, as in ‘the rape of the countryside’ was blue-pencilled out. If an adult who had been abused in a children’s home wished to expose his accusers, he had no medium to turn to. The only television and radio station was Xandir Malta/TVM/Radju Malta. The only newspapers apart from the ultra-conservative The Times and its sister Sunday were owned by the Nationalist Party and the General Workers Union, and there was no internet. These people had no way of making their accusations public.\\nThe media scene changed drastically only over the last 17 years or so, but even then, it was years before we began speaking and writing about child abuse, still more child abuse by nuns and priests. It was as though these things didn’t happen, when we knew they must have been happening, and so when a few people first began to speak out courageously, they were called liars and frauds. This discouraged others from coming forward.\\nThese particular adults, who were in the care of Dominican nuns at the Lourdes Home in Gozo when they were children, and who are of different ages, found that particular door slammed hard in their faces. The matter was taken up by the television show Bondiplus years later, in 2006. Eight men and women spoke in detail about their experiences. I was incensed at the cruelty and at the unfairness of life which heaps pain on those who have already been dealt a raw deal in terms of being abandoned by their parents and raised in a cold and barren institute by a wimple-and-habit-wearing regiment of women – an abnormal upbringing if ever there was one. Speaking for myself, I would have been happy never to see another wimple or habit again as long as I lived when I left convent-school, and I was there only Monday to Friday between 8am and 2pm in term-time. I swore that if I ever had a daughter I would send her to a state school rather than to a school run by nuns. Children should never be exposed on a daily basis to discipline meted out by women wearing weird back uniforms with no visible hair.\\nBy then, Gozo had a new bishop, Mario Grech, whose reaction to the testimony on Bondiplus was to set up another commission to study the situation afresh. This is very much to his credit, and indicates that his reaction to hearing those former inmates – for there is no better word to describe them – speak was the nagging suspicion that what they were saying was true.\\nThe commission, chaired by the retired (and respected) judge Victor Caruana Colombo, the lawyer Ruth Farrugia, the psychologist Angela Abela and Monsignor Fortunato Mizzi, presented its report to the Gozo diocese a few weeks ago – some 22 months past the deadline. The report was not made public, but last Friday, the bishop begged the forgiveness of those who had been abused, expressed his sorrow for what had happened, and explained that he has “appointed a team of experts who will accompany these persons through the healing process.”\\nThat’s good of him, but I suspect that what the victims really want and need is a grovelling apology from the actual nuns who did it, if they are still alive. And if they are still alive, the bishop should haul them out and demand that they apologise – not in public via the media, as he did, but in private to the adults who they hurt so badly as vulnerable children. Of course, what those adults probably really want, in their hearts of hearts, is to see them put in the stocks in a public square, forced to eat their own vomit after being force-fed, dragged along the streets by their hair, and have parts of their bodies ironed. But they’re not going to get that, so I’m sure they’ll settle for the apology.\\nThe bishop was quick to point out, though careful to say that it was no excuse, that there were only a few children who were abused in this way, and hundreds of others were well cared for. If he hasn’t heard of scapegoating, perhaps it should be explained to him carefully by the psychologist on the commission. This is what happens when just one or two children at any given time are picked on by the adult or adults in charge, victimised and psychologically isolated from the other children, who are encouraged to ‘hate’ the scapegoat and join in the process of singling him or her out for wicked treatment, or at the barest minimum doing nothing to help the scapegoat. The scapegoat becomes a non-person, a thing, and a culture of fear is created in which, so as to protect themselves, the rest don’t dare stand up against the cruelty. This kind of abuse of a few scapegoats is actually more terrible than the routine abuse of all the children, because if you are one abused child among many, you have the comfort of your peers. But if you are the scapegoat, you are isolated and rendered even more vulnerable.\\nThe commission has recommended to the Gozo diocese how best to avoid a repeat performance. We have not been told what these recommendations are, but one newspaper has quoted sources as saying that whoever is known to have abused a person, particularly a child, will not be allowed to be a care-worker again. Yes, but the problem is that the ban applies only to the field of religious care-work, and because the names of the abusers are not being made public, they are free to apply for similar work in the private and public sectors.\\nCalls are being made for the prosecution of these nuns, but so many years have elapsed that it isn’t possible. In any case, it is not up to the Gozo diocese to hand the details over to the police. It is up to the individuals who were abused. The police cannot prosecute without a formal report, and a request to investigate and prosecute (known as a ‘kwerela’), from them. They cannot and should not investigate the abuse of individuals who are now adults unless those individuals want them to. This much should be obvious. Where children are concerned, it’s a different matter altogether. Now the authorities – and by that I mean the state, and not the church – have a duty to ensure that what happened at the Lourdes Home and other institutes cannot happen again. It is time for the government to remember that it has a responsibility towards the children in church-run institutes, because the main reason they are being looked after by priests and nuns is because the government has conveniently forgotten that it is the state that should be providing for the care of abandoned children because this is no longer the Victorian Age.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nThey say that Wikipedia should never be used as a quoted source and always treated with scepticism. And nothing proves this better than the entry for Alfred Sant. Here is a delightful quote, replete with original errors of grammar, meaning and punctuation (and accuracy, of course):\\nDr Alfred Sant, post to his resignation as party leader was described as “…a fine, intelligent and honest politician”. To the latter he expressed himself as he has, and will have no regrets at all, albeit the fact that the Maltese electorate failed blatantly in seeing such qualities in him, and preferring the arrogance, incompetence and lack of integrity of the every-present P.N. Government. Dr Sant had to face unprecedented personal attacks, vilification and character assassination, which have certainly made their toll on his recent decision to resign irrevocably from the Malta Labour Party’s helm. The orchestrated hatred attacks stretched not only from the P.N. and its printed and broadcast media, but from the so called ‘independent’ English language newspapers in Malta, as well as from the State owned Television company Public Broadcasting Services – P.B.S. Such attacks were not limited to him or officials of the Malta Labour Party, but also to members of his family which have struggled to maintain a very discreet and low public profile.\\nThis must surely have led him, Dr Sant, to rethink his political career vis-à-vis his personal life, and how this was being effected, mostly in the light of his recent health issues, and his resignation will surely serve as a long term holiday and as an opportunity to stretch his horizons and be at the service, not only to the Maltese citizens as in the past three decades, but also at the Service of Europe and the World. Surely, his supporters shall miss him greatly, and the Maltese islands have lost a true honest, visionary and progressive leader.\\nAmen to that, from all of us whom he has Served in Europe and the World.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, April 6th, 2008 at 7:09 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHis website is www.falzonmichael.com because www.michaelfalzon.com is the fan-site of an Australian singer of the Jason Micallef type. But in any case, you’re not going to find anything interesting on it – no photographs of him riding elephants or touching his rear to the place where the Princess of Wales might have touched hers but didn’t; no pictures of his open-top sports car or invitations to hair-gel jamborees.\\nNo. The fascinating thing about this kid who grew up round the corner from me but who spent his time diligently studying in his father’s grocery while the rest of us ran about the streets is the way he comes across so very well in one-to-one situations and so very badly anywhere he sees a crowd and is given a microphone. He impressed us all with his performance at the counting-hall, and he did it again last Monday on Bondiplus. But here’s the thing: he’s also the man who yodelled into the mike at Labour’s largest mass meeting ever, and the who came up with the football analogy to describe party politics (“Hawn ahna, it-tim taghna – Lejber Junajtit!”)\\nYes, and he’s also the man who was deputy leader of the party when the party was told that it was going to win by a majority of at least 16,000 and then lost instead. He was deputy leader to the twice-defeated Alfred Sant who had also taken a hammering in the referendum. He was deputy leader of the Labour Party when it said it was ready to hit the ground running when an election was called and then it turned out that the party had no campaign to speak of because it thought it couldn’t lose no matter what it did or didn’t do.\\nAnd if you recall the clips from the television news and other public appearances of the Labour Party troika during the election campaign, when they were so sure they were going to win, the first thing that strikes you is how very different his demeanour was then to what it is now. Then he was arrogant and assertive, aggressive towards criticism, proud, self-assured and defiant (and rude, too). Now he is doing the meek lamb thing and hinting that he’s not to blame for what happened.\\nHow can the man who helped make such a great hash of things now hope to be seen as astute leadership material? I hope he is not going to join the queue of those now lining up to tell us that they disagreed with Sant and Jason but felt obliged to toe the line, so the defeat is not their fault but Sant’s and Jason’s.\\nOh come on. If you’re deputy leader for a full five years in the run-up to an election that your party loses when it should have won, you have been a major contribution to the problem – if not by your actions, then by your inaction.\\n  \\n\\n\\nMichael Falzon’s self-delusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, April 6th, 2008 at 7:13 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nWenzu Mintoff showed he knows even less about political marketing than Jason Micallef does when he told Malta Today last Sunday:\\nI can’t understand why the Labour leader only appeared on the Nationalist Party’s billboards. There was not a single Labour billboard showing the leader alone or together with the two deputy leaders. This was a total capitulation to the Nationalists’ campaign. We went to such an extreme in accepting the effectiveness of that campaign that we seemed ashamed of showing our own leader.\\nNo, Wenzu. They didn’t hide him because they were ashamed. They hid him because they knew he was the main thing scaring people away from Labour. And while they were hiding their leader, they ran a series of advertisements in the English-language newspapers criticising Lawrence Gonzi for hiding his former ministers.\\nNot only did the Labour Party keep Sant off the billboards, but they even tried to keep him out of the public eye as much as possible, except for tightly controlled situations in which he would take no questions from the media lest he gave the wrong sort of answer. When he was in a situation that couldn’t be scripted or controlled – the famous university debate, the equally famous encounter with Pullicino Orlando in the PBS studios – disaster ensued.\\n  \\n\\n\\nAnother troika pic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, April 6th, 2008 at 7:19 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nReading the prize-winning letter in last issue of M magazine, which is distributed with The Times, brought back fond memories of the days when for the price of a ticket to the MADC pantomime you would sometimes get, thrown in for free, an unscripted cabaret put on by Labour thugs, there to avenge the honour of their political masters, who had been joked about.\\nHere’s the letter, written by Christian Mifsud, who was stage manager during one such event.\\nReading your article about the bust-up during the 1985 edition of the MADC pantomime, Robinson Crusoe, brought back vivid memories of that ill-fated evening. I was the stage manager for that show and can still picture those three thugs bursting through the backstage entrance. We thought it was all over when they left their seating. Little did we know they were coming round the back.\\nWhile two of them tried to smash the props, the third one made a beeline for the sound-room to try and destroy the tapes. Five of us were on hand in the wings and a fight soon ensued. I was closest to the sound-room and with difficulty managed to restrain the thug from entering. More help was soon at hand and these three ‘guests’ were evicted. Damage was minimal but our nerves were certainly on edge.\\nThe incident did not end there. A member of the Manoel Theatre committee happened to be walking by and was frantically called in. Not appreciating the extent of what had just happened, he walked into the auditorium and was promptly met with a punch from an irritated member of the audience.\\nAll through the confusion, Maestro Vella did his best to keep the audience calm by playing Christmas carols, using the chorus as his main singers. Having calmed our nerves, we had an obligation to our paying audience and we continued with the show.\\nAs a member of the MADC committee at the time I know there was a lot more that happened behind the scenes but that would make another story.\\nOh, incidentally – Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party at the time, and Marie Louise Coleiro was secretary-general. Lovely.\\nA glance back at the madness of the recent past\\nWhat a pity I didn’t bother looking at this magazine before the election. There was such a gem in it.\\nIt is again in this context that Dr Sant brought up the Malta Labour Party’s proposed reception class, between the end of kindergarten and the start of formal primary education. This would, he admitted, increase the number of years children would spend in school……He also dismissed the idea that the cost would be prohibitive. “Yes, we will need more teachers, and we will need more space. But all that this means is that we would need another Lm1.5 million in the education budget and 200 more teachers. What’s wrong with that?”\\nThe Economic Update, February 2008\\nTwo hundred extra teachers, eh? And where were they going to come from? Perhaps he was going to wave his magic wig and whip them up out of thin air.\\nMy God, what a narrow escape that was.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nListen to Harry Vassallo in The Circle magazine yesterday.\\nAD’s success has been postponed since 2003. That was a moment in which we had the experience and political maturity and we were instrumental in helping Malta join the EU. The circumstances then were such that we had to campaign to give our votes away. I don’t feel frustrated at all today. Our contribution to Maltese politics is there.\\nSo that’s it. Without Harry Vassallo and AD, Malta wouldn’t have joined the European Union. People were convinced because Harry and his group campaigned in favour, and to hell with the Yes campaign team of hundreds and the Nationalist Party.\\nWell, what was Harry’s excuse this time? The last election, he said, was “not fought on issues, but on fears and loyalties.” Here’s more.\\nThis was the first election in which we suffered a direct assault from one of the major parties – the PN. It was effective except on those 3,800 people who voted for us. In general, the PN used every bit of its power of incumbency – Mater Dei, Smart Island, letters from the PM to civil servants and businessmen.\\nThe power of incumbency, eh? Now, where have I heard that one before? Apparently, it’s the fashionable excuse for losers. If I read Vassallo right, he’s speaking negatively about the government’s successes as some form of abuse of the power of incumbency. In other words, if you’re in government don’t you dare do anything right lest people be tempted to vote for you again and not for Harry Vassallo or the MLP. It’s not fair that the political party in government has an advantage like that. They should mess up to make for a level playing-field.\\nLou Bondi, who interviewed Vassallo for this magazine article, asked him why 30,000 people decided not to vote at all rather than vote AD. Harry kien bir-risposta lesta.\\nThis shows that a vote for AD is not a protest vote. Protest voters stay at home. We don’t have a country. We have two countries occupying the same space. Each of them explains the universe to its supporters. The best example of this is when one protests against one’s party, one takes the step of not voting, but not that of voting for another party.\\nAh, so that explains it, then. People don’t vote for AD because they prefer to protest by staying at home. Or they are influenced by the government’s power of incumbency. Or they’re Labourites who can’t stand Sant but won’t vote PN because we’re two tribes.\\nAnd if you think you’ve seen the back of Harry Vassallo, you’ve got another think coming. He’s going to be joining the parade of political dinosaurs who won’t leave us alone. Doesn’t the prospect of another five years of thankless political work scare him, Bondi asked? “No. It’s the thought of not being in politics that scares me,” he replied.\\nHe has offered to resign, as opposed to actually resigning, irrevocably or otherwise, and like Sant in 2003 will pop right back into the permanent leadership if AD people do a sufficient amount of palm-frond waving as he rides into town on his donkey. “I see no reason to leave,” Vassallo said.\\nWell, it’s not up to you, buster. Jason Micallef sees no reason to leave, either – nor did Sant in 1998 and 2003. Michael Falzon sees so little reason to leave that he’s actually asking people to make him the party leader.\\nAnd then on the winning side, they’re all leaving. Nationalist Party secretary-general Joe Saliba is waving goodbye in a couple of months. Information secretary Gordon Pisani is doing the same. They’re heading off for pastures new, doing the right thing and leaving on a high, allowing space for the fresh faces that are already part of the plan for a new Nationalist Party come 2013 (that’s one reason why they win elections).\\nMeanwhile, the Labour Party leadership election is looking increasingly like a bunch of ferrets fighting in a sack.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nWhen the Irrevocably Resigned leader of the Labour Party got a bee in his bonnet about something, you could tell it was a personal bugbear and his constant banging on about the subject was a form of catharsis. Hence corruption (he was president of the Labour Party in the mid-1980s, when both party and government were at their most corrupt) and the hofra (the Labour Party was seriously in debt back then and matters have deteriorated further).\\nNow, to all intents and purposes the Labour Party is bankrupt. A state of bankruptcy occurs when you owe more money than you can ever hope to pay back. Rumours about Labour’s horrendous debts are rife, and now here comes Anna Mallia to state as fact that those debts are in seven figures.\\nThe new leader will have a tough job to try and put the accounts of the party in order; to audit how and why the party is in debt for more than Lm3 million.\\nAnna Mallia, Malta Today, yesterday\\nI know it’s difficult, but I wish people would make a little bit more of an effort to think in terms of euros. So according to Anna Mallia, the Labour Party owes €7 million or thereabouts.\\nHow is it going to pay back that kind of money, given how it insists with us that it depends for survival on flus minghand iz-zghir? When Price Club collapsed, that was roughly the amount of its debt.\\nBut there are too many vested interests in keeping a political party shored up way beyond the point of bankruptcy. I can’t see the banks foreclosing and forcing the sale of the Mile End Glasshouse (prime piece of property, there) or private suppliers suing for payment. I have to say it would be interesting if that happens, given that it is about the only thing that will force the Labour Party to rise anew from the ashes minus that parade of freaks and dinosaurs.\\nIt’s amazing that 140,000+ people believe the Labour Party when it says that it would manage this country much better financially than the Nationalist government does. How can it be trusted to do this when it can’t even put its own house in order? When the Labour Party says that it can cut Malta’s deficit when its own deficit has taken on a life of its own, the only possible response is loud laughter.\\n  \\n\\n\\nPiggy bank\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, April 7th, 2008 at 9:50 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nOur spy at Labour HQ\\nOur spy at Labour HQ tells us that the letter instructing leadership hopefuls not to talk to the media or be disqualified from the race was just a joke for April Fool’s Day, designed to prove that Labour has a sense of humour. He pointed out that the letter sent to Labour’s electoral commission from its Board of Vigilance and Discipline is dated 1 April.\\nHmmm. I’m not so sure. The Labour Party cracks its April Fool jokes on 31 March – hence the gut-wrenchingly unfunny Maltastar.com story last Monday about a new porn channel for Malta, asking people to send in their details to register their interest. Apparently, 2000 did so without checking the contact details given, which directed you to the Malta Labour Party and not to a porn company. Or maybe the toby-jug-shaped (and sized) person who runs Maltastar.com doesn’t know why it’s called April Fool’s Day when it’s celebrated on Jum il-Helsien. I think that’s the more likely explanation. Nobody intelligent could possibly take on the job of running Maltastar.com unless he had long-term ambitions, like that Poodle, whose first job it was.\\nI think the real joke is in the fact that they first issued a ban which can’t possibly work, then they were left with an ambiguous situation which they didn’t know how to handle, and so they almost immediately retracted the ban, but not before the entire country had begun to laugh at them for imposing it in the first place.\\nHow does a media-contact ban work, exactly? It shows that these people didn’t really think it through. But then, do they ever? So we ban Michael Falzon from giving an interview. And we ban the reporters and broadcasters who are employed with Super One from giving him coverage. We persuade the newspapers owned by the General Workers Union to play along.\\nAh, but here’s the thing: we can’t ban the rest of the media from writing about Michael Falzon and discussing his various merits and demerits. We can’t prevent columnists who are fans of Michael Falzon from writing hagiographic pieces about him. And above all, we can’t prevent those who don’t like him from tearing him to shreds or mocking him in their blogs and their on-line forums. Or those who like him from uploading websites filled with pictures and information about Michael Falzon. But we can prevent Michael Falzon from replying to criticism and putting across his version. None of this makes any sense, and bears a remarkable similarly to the decisions to remove VAT, find oil or else, put in a repeater class, and sell partnership with the EU to a sceptical electorate. Do I detect a pattern here?\\nI use Michael Falzon as an example. The same holds true for the rest of them – though quite frankly, I would have liked to see the Board of Vigilance and Discipline trying to disqualify Joseph Muscat from the race in defiance of Alfred Sant’s wishes, if he decided to carry on with his self-publicity regardless. I think that’s the most likely reason for their summary retraction of the ban. They realised they’d made themselves hostages to fortune. If they had a bit of a brain about them, they would have realised this immediately. “Oh my god, the Poodle has defied the ban and gone on Xarabank. What do we do now? We can’t disqualify him.”\\nAjma, jahasra. Then we had Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, using sophistry to justify the press conference she gave to announce her candidature in the brief period the ban was in force. She said she had called the press conference before she received instructions to behave herself and not speak to the press. Then she said that ‘unlike the other candidates’ she had not made a public declaration of her interest in the leadership before she received those instructions. So she felt at liberty to carry on with the press conference and stick to the rules afterwards. She claimed that Labour’s electoral commission agreed with her.\\nWell, I don’t know about that. This is what the chairman of Labour’s electoral commission wrote to leadership candidates and prospective candidates in his letter dated 1 April. He wrote that “whoever somehow showed an interest in contesting a leadership post” was not to give comments to the media. “I’ve also been instructed to inform you that whoever fails to abide by these instructions will be disqualified from submitting his nomination once the nominations are open,” he wrote. Clearly, Mrs Coleiro Preca would not have been written to had she not fallen into this category of persons.\\nMaybe she was the one to defy them, and then they had a real problem on their hands. “Oh my god, Marie Louise is giving a press conference. Now how do we disqualify her from the leadership race without turning her into a martyr to the cause of feminism?”\\nSigh. The chairman of Labour’s electoral commission told questing journalists more or less that they should mind their own business because “these are internal party matters.” Mrs Coleiro Preca takes that same argument and stretches it: the election of a Labour Party leader is an internal party matter, but to reach the “900 delegates and more than 140,000 who vote Labour” you have to use the media, she said.\\nOh, so by that reasoning, the national media are there to be used to serve the interests of Labour’s leadership contenders, the Labour Party, the delegates and those who vote Labour. Well, I’m not sure I get that, but then I wasn’t secretary-general of the Labour Party during Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici’s reign of terror.\\nAs it would happen, a reporter asked Mrs Coleiro Preca about that part of her CV during the press conference. And here’s what the woman who wants to take Labour into the 21st century replied:\\nI think we didn’t work enough on the history of the Labour Party and heard only the version of others. I went to express my solidarity, along with a number of other MLP officials, at the Gudja PN club a few hours after Raymond Caruana was shot, but nobody says that.\\nReally? The shooting of Raymond Caruana was the only terrible thing that happened while she was secretary-general of the Labour Party? It was the worst single thing that happened, yes, because it involved loss of life. But let’s not forget that the climate of oppression and fear that led to that killing didn’t just happen. It was created.\\nHowever nice Mrs Coleiro Preca may be today, she can’t have been nice in the past and still been secretary-general of such an ugly political party. The last thing the Labour Party needs is a leader who was secretary-general when KMB was leader. Look at all the flak Alfred Sant got when people suddenly realised – way too late after 1996 – that he wasn’t a new face at all, but was president of the Labour Party during the days of its worst excesses in the mid-1980s. They hadn’t noticed him earlier because he was such a nonentity, forever lurking in the background making his creepy plans.\\nThen after 1998, every time his lips formed the word ‘corruption’ (not that his lips move) a chorus would shout: “And where were you in 1984? Oh yes, you were president of the Labour Party, when the Labour Party was at its most corrupt and violent.” The Nationalist Party used this very fact to great effect in its most recent electoral campaign.\\nIt’s a question of credibility, that’s all.\\n  \\n\\n\\nOur spy at Labour HQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, April 7th, 2008 at 10:56 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHark at that Evarist Bartolo in Malta Today, yesterday.\\nElecting the next leader of the Labour party is obviously not just an internal party matter. The way we behave in the process will have a great impact not just on party delegates and members but also on the electorate at large. A party that aspires to govern the country must show that it can govern itself.\\nWe must make an effort to behave in a dignified manner and not allow the election of the next leadership and administration of the Labour party to degenerate into fratricide.\\nWe must stop tearing each other apart. I have already said during the last 10 years that what worries me about the Labour Party is that there is too much infighting, too much biting at each other’s tails and it has to stop. I know it happens in every political party especially after an electoral defeat and when it is caught up in choosing the next leadership. We need a cultural change inside the party that allows for more diversity and disagreement, but also compromise.\\nThis from the man who stuck by Sant through his every whim and madness – who never challenged him, never opposed him, never told him where to stuff it, and who bowed his head meekly and withdrew from the leadership race when Sant decided he wasn’t resigning after all in 2003.\\nMaria l-Maws should know that political infighting is sometimes a good thing, and that if the party had had more political infighting over the last 16 years, Labour wouldn’t have ended up with Alfred the Albatross around its neck after his third consecutive defeat – two general elections and one referendum – in 2003.\\nNow, after sucking up to Sant for all these years, Maria l-Maws expects us to vest him with even one iota of credibility as the new leader of the Labour Party.

It was not appealing enough to the middle classes. Easy grinning was no substitute for the politics of penetration. The overall line was too aggressive, at times frightening. It misread the signals the electorate was transmitting. Assistance from those prepared to give a hand at personal sacrifice was scorned.\\nEven the repeated emphasis on zero tolerance to corruption is being questioned.\\nMore than where will it end, one should ask why did it begin now. What was the level and state of internal strategic discussion within the Malta Labour Party? Were the faults so obvious in the aftermath of defeat pointed out before the votes were cast? Were they brushed aside? Or was there god-like reluctance to listen to and heed sound warnings from mere mortals? Or – more remarkably still – was there near-total silence, complete acquiescence to the line decided upon and shot by the few who held the sceptre of power in their hands?\\nNo, they didn’t know what was going wrong at the time. They are speaking only now with the benefit of hindsight. Before 9 March they hadn’t a clue and were brimful of confidence in victory. Maria l-Maws, who is busy writing newspaper columns now in which he portrays himself as weighed down with introspective wisdom, was busy writing other newspaper columns then in which he explained to us in great detail why the Labour Party was going to win. I remember with particular pleasure one column in which he described how confident he was of victory because of all the people he was meeting on his house-calls in Sliema who told him they always voted PN but would be switching to Labour.\\nI wonder who Lino Spiteri was referring to when he wrote this.\\nGoing by the revelations made so far, the MLP needs sound penetrating policies, not grins switched on and off as if in some starlet revue.\\nI can only imagine it was those two metrosexual JMs – Jason Micallef and Joseph Muscat, the twin stars of Labour’s starlet revue.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nMarie Louise Coleiro Preca was secretary-general of the Labour Party between 1982 and 1991 – the Karmenu years. Yet like Alfred Sant, she has no regrets. This is what she told The Sunday Times last Sunday.\\nI am not ashamed of my political past. I was general secretary of the party and when there was abuse of power nobody consulted the party….they just went ahead and did it. If those who abused power were not brought to book, that is something else. But again, we had a series of such stories…we cannot just focus on a part of the story.\\nIs this woman for real? Is she trying to suggest that the Labour Party should be exonerated from the blame for all the evils of the 1970s and 1980s because it wasn’t consulted before the abuse took place?\\nLet me pause to draw breath. Coleiro Preca is saying here that the Labour government was directly responsible for no abuse, and that where abuse was committed, it wasn’t even indirectly responsible. And that is why she isn’t ashamed of having been the party’s secretary-general at a time when the worst of those excesses were taking place, and Labour was at its most corrupt and violent (which is saying something).\\nBut here she is again.\\nI am against violence wherever it comes from and this country went through some very unfortunate and shameful incidents. As a citizen I am still expecting justice for the families of Karin Grech and Raymond Caruana.\\nKarin Grech and Raymond Caruana, because they died – but how about all those other thousands who suffered in one way or another because of the madness of the political party of which Marie Louise Coleiro Preca was secretary-general? They didn’t lose their life so of course, they have nothing to complain about.\\nHaving failed miserably to put her role in the 1980s into its true perspective, she now claims to be the one to want a system of ‘constant evaluation’ and ‘auto-critique’ in the Labour Party. It’s more likely to be a system of self-justification and no regrets.\\nAnd then she said, with a total absence of irony:\\nEven I myself, if elected leader, would have to submit myself to periodic evaluation…in every aspect but especially in ethical matters…Unfortunately, this country lags behind in these areas. We still don’t really have a culture of public responsibility.\\nHer interviewer asked whether she thinks now that her party’s position on EU membership was mistaken, and Marie Louise Coleiro Preca immediately began to rewrite history.\\nWe didn’t explain ourselves well enough. I’m not going to go into the slogans Switzerland in the Mediterranean, Partnership and so on.\\nOh, so they were only slogans, and not policies, as we were told?\\nOur message was that we weren’t ready for membership. It’s not a question of the EU being bad.\\nReally? It isn’t? Then why was her boss Sant barking ‘Allahares nidhlu fl-Ewropa’ with his insufferable poodle yapping the same thing alongside?\\nThe Nationalist Party as far back as the 1990s wanted us to join the EU, but procrastinated with the reforms needed to upgrade the country in general. So a number of issues stemming from the acquis came upon us all of a sudden.\\nUnbelievable. I can’t credit these leadership contenders. Look at them all lining up to distance themselves from everything that happened in the last 16 years – or, as in Coleiro Preca’s case, the last 26 years. First they all knew they were going to lose the election but were helpless because the losing team kept everything hidden from them and refused their help and advice. Now suddenly, none of them were against EU membership for Malta – just a little bit cautious, that’s all, and they don’t want to have anything to do with those cheap slogans that Sant coined.\\nIt’s a little bit too late for that, honeys.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nJolly good thing this floor-mop looks so much like the Labour torca, because the way the party is heading, with millions in debts, a twerpy Poodle as leader and a collection of freak officials and candidates along the lines of Victorian bearded ladies and elephant men, it’s destined to entrench its position as the Malta Opposition Party.\\nLet’s face it. Between 1962 and 2013 – a full 51 years – the Labour Party won the majority of votes just three times, in 1971, 1976 and 1996. And in 1996 it couldn’t stay in power longer than 22 months. In 51 years, Labour has governed legitimately for just 12 years and illegitimately (with a minority of votes in the 1981 election) for five years.\\nThe only reason we don’t realise that the Labour Party is really the Malta Opposition Party is because 15 of those 17 years came stuck together like glue, were beyond miserable and endless, and it seemed that Labour would dominate our lives forever. Those 15 years saw the growth of the Allahares-jitla-l-Lejber generation.\\nThe only good thing that came out of them was the reminder that the Labour Party, which makes a hopeless Opposition, invariably makes a hopeless government. They can’t run their own show and yet they expect to run the country. They say they can cut the country’s deficit (it’s being done already) but they’re technically bankrupt.\\nThe mystery to me is why 140,000+ people keep voting for this bunch of losers who can’t do anything right. Is it like supporting some kind of obscure football team just to be different? Is it adherence to principles that the Labour Party itself has long since jettisoned, if it ever had them in the first place after the 1960s?\\nWith that kind of market, it’s no wonder Labour has not felt the impetus for change. With the carrot of government forever dangling before its nose, it failed to smarten up its act and so has been doomed to spend 34 years out of 51 years in Opposition.\\n  \\n\\n\\nMop\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, April 8th, 2008 at 11:33 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe caption to this picture on www.anglufarrugia.com is ‘India visit – Dr Anglu Farrugia in a sacred mosque’. As opposed to what, we wonder – a profane mosque?\\nThe standard of police work wasn’t very high in the days of Commissioner Lorry Pullicino. We all know that, but apparently former inspector Anglu Farrugia does not. He still thinks with a 1980s mind. Here he is in Malta Today last Sunday, talking about the sale of votes.\\nI am not saying that the PN was involved. I am only saying that votes were traded so that people would not vote for the MLP….Since the election was won by 1500, this means that the party would have won with an extra 700 votes.\\nGive the man a calculator: 1500 divided by two is 750.\\nThis means that if 10 votes were bought in every locality, the election would have been won by the MLP.\\nI had to read that three times. What is he trying to say? Coherence is not his strong point. Is he saying that if the MLP had bought 10 votes in each district, Alfred Sant would be prime minister today? Oh, I get it – he’s saying that if he can prove that 10 votes in every district were bought, then he can prove that the MLP would have won the election if they hadn’t been bought.\\nI still don’t get it, though – because he would have to prove that the people from whom the votes were bought would have voted Labour if they hadn’t sold their votes. And he would also have to get over the implied embarrassment of what he is saying: that you would have to be a Labour voter to sell your vote for some readies. Anglu tal-iljunfant carries on:\\nI am not saying that this happened and so far I am not disputing that the PN won the election.\\nSo far, eh? It looks like there are treats a many in store for us.\\nThe system works like this. One would need one or two million euros to buy votes. This money is divided among a number of agents. Each agent engages the services of runners – the foot soldiers who actually buy the votes. The runners visit bars frequented by drug addicts and people who are more interested in having some cash than in voting.\\nIs this man for real? Using Alfred Mifsud’s arguments (see his article last Sunday in The Malta Independent on Sunday) I should criticise him relentlessly to ensure that the delegates choose him as party leader and condemn Labour to Opposition for another 15 years or so (Labour leaders don’t resign when they lose two elections in a row).\\nWas Anglu Farrugia’s interviewer half asleep at the time? One or two million euros. Agents. Runners. Drug addicts. For heaven’s sake – whose money does he think it was? Where did that kind of money come from? Who organised the agents and the runners, and more to the point, who were the agents and the runners?\\nThere’s a more interesting question he should have been asked, and it’s this one. Why does he conclude that drug addicts and people who are more interested in having some cash are natural Labour voters? (“There’s a drug addict. He must vote Labour. Let’s buy his vote.”)\\nThe Labour Party is in the mess it is now because over the years it has ended up as a dustbin for bizarre politicos. We have had a parade of them over the last few years. Labour is sinking fast under their weight. The secretary-general is a disaster; the future leader is a ridiculous, jumped-up twerp, and the party itself is laden with baggage like Anglu Farrugia and his illogical thinking.\\nRemind me again what sort of degree this man was awarded by our magnificent university with its supremely high standards?\\nHere he is again.\\nI have experience in monitoring elections both through my experience in OSCE and the European Commission. I have observed elections in Palestine and in Zambia and I know how these things work.\\nPalestine. Zambia. And what did the Indian elephant have to say about it? Oh, go and stick your head in some nice, large hole in the wall, Anglu. You’re an embarrassment to yourself and even more of an embarrassment to the Labour Party. Read my lips: the Labour Party has been on a regular losing ticket because of people like you.\\nNow it looks like he has even implicated two former members of the last cabinet before this one in his three-page ‘report’ to the Paraventu (mela he’s not a Paraventu, now?). This is what he had to say about his Inspector Morse endeavours.\\nI am not saying that they were directly involved in buying votes. My report talks of both vote-buying and favours granted on the eve of the election.\\nOh, for pity’s sake. Somebody find this man another elephant he can have an international affair with, because he clearly needs some distraction. Here’s more.\\nYes, I have a video. I have a video showing someone voting for the PN.\\nAnglu Farrugia would have failed my logic classes, I imagine, not that I remember much of them myself. He has a video showing somebody voting for the PN. Wow. Amazing. Given that 140,000+ people did just that, his video is hardly going to make it to a David Attenborough show about rare wildlife.\\nDoes he also have a video proving that this person filmed voting PN would have voted MLP if he hadn’t been paid not to do so? Ah, now that’s the difficult bit. And even if he has just such a video, does he have another one that proves that the person really would have voted MLP and wasn’t just taking the money and running because money or not, he was going to do what I did and vote PN anyway? With brains like these….\\nAnglu Farrugia has even more interesting theories about people pretending to be illiterate when they vote. Just listen to him and try to understand what he’s saying.\\nFor example, let us say that Angelo was going to vote in Gronier Street in polling-booth number 405. Upon entering the polling-both, Angelo declares that he needs assistance because he is illiterate. In this way, those involved would have known that Angelo voted for the PN. There were many illiterates in this election.\\nNo, I didn’t get it either. I clearly don’t have the right kind of mind to be a popular Labour politician, for which the main requirement seems to be – well, let’s not go into it.\\nThe thing is that Angelo Farrugia continues to have leadership aspirations. Here goes.\\nIf the report indicates that the style of leadership required by the party is different from what I can offer, I will submit to the party’s best interest, and desist from contesting. But if the party requires a certain type of leader and a deputy leader with a different character, for example, someone who is more mature, I would consider contesting for deputy leader for parliamentary affairs…..If I become leader, the Nationalist Party will have a major problem. I will make their life difficult. Personally, I would never agree to a pairing agreement with the Nationalists. Back in 1996, the Nationalists made our life hell. That is what we should do to them now.\\nOh, that will really come across well and appeal to the middle ground – another Mintoff/Karmenu clone, but without the right stuff between the ears. And he doesn’t even realise that in 1996, it was Alfred Sant who made the Labour Party’s life hell, and nobody else, with his mad, harebrained schemes and his complete disregard for the effect on people’s lives and the economy of his weird decisions.\\nNo. The man obviously has an absolute dearth of insight and perception. In what possible scenario might he imagine that it would be in the Labour Party’s interest to have him as leader? How does he imagine that he might make a good prime minister, or that the majority of the population would allow him to be one? For different reasons, he would be as bad as Joseph Muscat, and as unappealing to all those who voted PN or stayed at home in this general election.\\n  \\n\\n\\nAnglu Farrugia in a mosque\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, April 8th, 2008 at 12:55 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nShock headline: “Joseph Muscat risked bankruptcy by buying me for his children,” says this Hershey Bar\\nI watched the Poodle being interviewed by Reno Bugeja on Dissett last night – the balding Poodle, incidentally, which is no problem at all, given that he’s a man and not really a dog, but with the Labour Party’s history of wigs, you can’t really be too sure what’s going to happen.\\nHe was at his most predictably prat-like, telling people what they want to hear without the slightest sign of conviction. They want a discussion on divorce? I’m up for it. They want an apology for the 1980s? They’ll get one (but the Nationalists have to apologise too, for the 1960s and the Interdett). Somebody should explain to Dr Joseph Muscat DBA how it was the Archbishop’s Curia that was responsible for the Interdett and not the Nationalist Party.\\nThe 1960s were the years of acid trips, but I don’t think anyone was tripping so hard that they could see a situation in which George Borg Olivier instructed people not to vote Labour because it was a mortal sin and they would be buried in unhallowed ground on his express instructions. That was the Curia’s business. Borg Olivier had some more pressing mortal sins to contend with at the time, if memory serves me right – but enough about that.\\nI like Reno Bugeja’s style. His questions are pressing and pointed without being aggressive, and he’s polite and reserved without letting things go. The bit I liked best was when he asked Mr Silly with the ever-ready smile about the giant deficit the Labour government saddled Malta with during its brief 22-month legislature. With his vast array of dikris in economics, for one brief moment there the Poodle didn’t seem sure what he was talking about.\\nYou’d think he’s perfectly placed to discuss something like this, but no. So what did he do instead? His smile faltered briefly and then he said that it was the Nationalist government that created a deficit, by opening up the kaxxa ta’ Malta that Mintoff and Karmenu had so thriftily stacked full, and splurging all that lovely lolly. “The economy started doing well, but all the reserves were gone,” Mr Silly said, recovering his smirk. A brief tussle followed, in which Bugeja asked him whether he had really understood the question, and Dr Joseph Muscat DBA replied:\\nYes. The Nationalists took the riservi and began spending them. Sure, the economy did well, but that’s not the point. This is like when you have a missier ta’ familja, and he takes the flus tal-familja and begins spending it, buying his family what they want, cikkulati and things, and then what happens?\\nOh, I see – chocolate economics. Well, he won’t go bankrupt by buying chocolates for his kids, that’s for sure. I don’t think the Labour Party’s bankrupt because Sant and Jason bought chocolates for the staff.\\nAside from his interesting take on economics (and here’s another one who, like Anglu tal-iljunfant and Alfred Sant, accumulated dikris and came out the other end without a clue), there’s the small matter of his paternalistic view of family life: missier ta’ familja li jiehu l-flus tal-familja u jixtri ic-cikkulati lit-tfal (u probabilment jaghti l-poketmani lil-mara ukoll, miskina, l-aqwa li ma tberbaqhomx).\\nIt looked like a job interview\\nI watched the show with a feeling of disquiet, unable to put my finger on what the problem was. Then one of my sons (the same one who wanted to know who the used-car salesman was when he found me watching Jason Micallef on Bondiplus before the election campaign) plonked himself down on the sofa and blurted out: “Don’t you think it looks like a job interview?”\\nBingo! That’s exactly what the problem was. That’s what it looked like: a prospective employer interviewing a prospective employee. Reno Bugeja had far more authority and gravitas than the wannabe prime minister, and the wannabe prime minister looked like one of the hundreds of Identikit thirty-something men in their Identikit suits, sitting an interview for a job with a financial services company and trying to impress the interviewer with their smartness and their confident smiles (and not getting anywhere).\\nTo boil things down to their essence: Joseph Muscat doesn’t look like he’s up for the job of prime minister. He looks like he’s up for the very job he had with Alfred Mifsud’s investment advisory company before he became an MEP. He is indistinguishable from the legions of young men who are in precisely that same kind of job. He is not out of their league, but in their league. The Labour Party might as well go down to HSBC or GlobalCapital, to pluck two of the better known names out of a hat, do a rapid eeny-meeny-miney-mo, and pick any one of the young men there as party leader. And I’m sure they’d be nicer, too.\\nI can just picture Joseph Muscat selling investments. I just can’t picture him running the country. He doesn’t have what it takes. Full stop.\\n  \\n\\n\\nHershey bar\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 9th, 2008 at 12:37 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nI would have been Norman Lowell if I hadn’t been born in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nApparently, entering Maltese politics in anything other than the Nationalist Party is not permissible unless you are the 21st-century equivalent of a 19th-century fairground attraction like a bearded lady or elephant man (oh dear).\\nBondiplus was decorated with two such specimens the night before last: the madman and the Moonie, a strange duo if ever there was one, and more so because each runs a different ‘political party’ and stands for election on a competing ticket. Emmy Bezzina is Mr Alpha Party, remember.\\nNorman Lowell is indisputably one sandwich short of a picnic, and seems to have served no purpose on the show other than that of a circus act, with Bondi speaking in careful tones as though to somebody insane and in possession of a loaded weapon.\\nThen there was that Emmy Bezzina, repeatedly saying that he was on the show as Lowell’s legal adviser – as though it is the norm for studio guests to take their lawyers along, just in case they’re served with a writ while on camera.\\nI’m not going to bother discussing all that Lowell said. We’ve been there before, ad nauseam, and not much could be picked up between all those long bleeps to wipe out his swear-words and obscenities, in any case.\\nAnd there’s another man who wears his watch over his sleeve, and he’s not Gianni Agnelli back from the dead, either. What a pair they make.\\nNow Lowell has appealed against the decision of the court which gave him a two-year prison sentence suspended for four years. He tells us that he is going to save Malta from disaster and return the island (Gozo is the realm of peasants and sheep, not of the elite) to the paradise in the Mediterranean that it was in the 1800s.\\nTruly, he’s bonkers. Malta was anything but paradise in the 1800s. It was hell on earth for everyone but the wealthy or comfortably-off few. It was a place of starvation, disease, misery and gross hardship, with an average of 50 babies and children under five dying EVERY WEEK – and this when the population was so much smaller than it is now. Thousands of other children languished in orphanages, people begged on the streets and lived in the gutter, and Lowell himself may have had antenati in just such dire straits, though of course he wishes us to believe that he comes from the lineage of demi-gods.\\nI wish all these freaks and weirdos would go away and leave room for some normal people to get into politics. I’m beginning to wonder about the words of the geneticist interviewed on Bondiplus in any case: that inbreeding is bad for the gene-pool because it brings faulty genes to the fore. No wonder there are so many cranks in the country, with the rest of us accepting them as part and parcel of public life, rather than seeing them for the cranks that they are and wondering how on earth they got to be in the public eye.\\n  \\n\\n\\nNorman Lowell\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 9th, 2008 at 12:41 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAlfred Sant is like one of those trick birthday candles. You think you’ve blown them out, but you haven’t. When he gave that press conference saying that he was Irrevocably Resigning, people thought he was riding off into the sunset or taking a world cruise (chance would be a fine thing). They even berated me for continuing to go on at him instead of letting him go in peace.\\nNot that I want to be mistaken for that pruzuntuz Joseph Muscat or anything, but I knew better and I thought that press conference was a ridiculous farce. Now we are told by The Times that Alfred Sant (who said at that press conference that he will not be the leader of the Opposition) will be the leader of the Opposition when parliament reconvenes on 10 May. You don’t have to be the leader of the party to be the leader of the Opposition, but you do have to have a seat in parliament, and Sant never did formally resign as Opposition leader, he resigned only as party leader.\\nYes, but there were other surprises in store yesterday evening on Dissett, that civilised interview show (but Reno, you really have to ditch all those horizontal lines on the studio set – they’re awful). Michael Falzon was asked why he didn’t resign as deputy leader before contesting the post of leader. Damn right he should have resigned, but these people are unbelievable. The only way to get rid of them is by clipping the fingernails they use to cling to the cliff-face.\\nAh, Falzon said – but Charles Mangion resigned and yet is acting leader. And Alfred Sant said he resigned but really he’s still the leader.\\nOh, yes? And how does that work, exactly? The resigned deputy leader is now acting leader, but really the actual leader (who said he had Resigned Irrevocably) is still leader after all. So that justifies him staying on as deputy leader while fighting for the top job.\\nAlfred Sant is still leader? That’s big news to me. It’s probably big news to everyone else.

After all, he knows what he’s talking about. Check out one of the most notorious investigations in all of Maltese political history. When Lino Cauchi disappeared (and his body found years later in a well), what did Inspector Farrugia do? He sent for the distraught Mrs Cauchi at night, had her flung into one of those hideous cells at the depot lock-up, kept her for hours and interrogated her, shouting: “Where’s Lino! You must know where he is!” Meanwhile, Mrs Cauchi’s father was outside the depot gate, screaming that they weren’t going to do to his daughter what they did to Nardu Debono. That’s a fine way to deal with a woman whose husband has just gone missing – unless you know who the husband’s clients were, and what sort of business he carried out on their behalf.

The only political parties I can see that have been irremediably damaged (though without being victorious, hence no Pyrrhic victory there either) are the Labour Party and Alternattiva Demokratika. So please, for the sake of your own credibility, stop calling the PN victory a Pyrrhic victory, because it just isn’t one.\\nA Pyrrhic victory is a victory with devastating cost to the victor. The phrase is an allusion to King Pyrrhus of Epirus (that’s in ancient Greece), whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the Romans at Heraclea in 280BC, and at Asculum in 279BC, in what is known as the Pyrrhic War. Plutarch described it:\\nThe armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that one more such victory would utterly undo him. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nEveryone seems to be thrilled because the Labour Party’s election commission has ruled that anyone who is a paid-up party member can contest the leadership elections. Until then, there had been rumours that only delegates would be allowed to contest, and George Abela is famously not a party delegate.\\nBut George Abela is a lawyer, and a pretty sharp one at that. So when deciding whether to go for it or not, he didn’t wait for a ruling from the electoral commission. He read the Labour Party’s statute. “It was clear to me from the outset that I am eligible, because the party statute says so,” he told this newspaper.\\nThose who propose and second the nominations for the leadership (as in all such situations, you have to be proposed and seconded) need also be no more than paid-up members, and not necessarily delegates. Yes, but here’s the thing. In all elections that I can think of (I am sure some of you will put me straight if I’m wrong on this one), those who are eligible to contest come from the ranks of those who are eligible to vote. In other words, if you can vote, then you can also contest – hence, shareholders voting to elect their representatives on the board of directors (who must also be shareholders) and at the level we are all familiar with – any Maltese citizen can be a candidate in a general election, and any Maltese citizen above the age of 18 can vote.\\nIf any Labour Party member can stand for election to the leadership, then it follows that any Labour Party member should be able to vote, and not just the delegates. With its strange and silly ruling that only delegates may vote, Labour’s electoral commission has reduced the party leadership election to an odd animal that is neither here nor there.\\nGiven that the people involved will be choosing the man or woman who will make the party or break it further, and who might end up making or breaking Malta, this is a serious business and the rules, which have failed the party so miserably in the past – most evidently in 2003 – just have to be changed to reflect normal practice.\\nDr Joseph Muscat DBA looked incongruous being interviewed by Reno Bugeja on TVM’s Dissett the night before last. He came across as a jumped-up kid (at 34 he should be deeper and more mature) with pretensions and more ambition than talent, sitting for a job interview with the human resources manager of a financial services company, and failing. You could see the interviewer thinking, “I hope the next interviewee is better, because I’m about to despair.”\\nBut of course, the next candidate, Michael Falzon, was even worse, for different reasons. Without the MGM cartouche around his neck and the excitement of yodelling to a crowd of tens of thousands, he seems to have morphed into an exponent of one of these ‘we live in Christ’ movements, all quiet voices and restrained thinking and measured tones and do unto others as you wish to be done by. Oh, come off it. We admired him in the counting-hall when skin-deep Jason ditched him to keep the boss company and then got a police escort to drive them home to bed, but there are limits. My memory isn’t that short and I can still remember Michael Falzon raging and shouting in the election campaign and never allowing the slightest glimmer of a smile to reach his lips. Jason smiled all the time, even where not appropriate, and the others never smiled at all. What a bunch.\\nI got so bored with Falzon’s prating that I wandered off for a glass of wine, came back, did some work at my computer with the television on low volume in the background, and ended up turning it off completely. Magnetic, I must say – really enthralling.\\nI watched Muscat all the way through, on the other hand, because he makes for compelling viewing in the same way as one of those widget figures in the Southpark cartoons. They grate and squeak, but still you have to watch. Three minutes into the show, I felt I was watching Alfred Sant in 1996. He used to smile then, and just as artificially. Muscat’s verbal and non-verbal tics and communication are modelled entirely on Sant. He mirrors him. That’s part of what I mean about his being a follower, not a leader. A real leader would have a forma mentis and mode of expression all his own. It was almost creepy.\\nThe difference is that Muscat’s personality is better-adjusted, which means that he knows, at least in theory, the proper way to respond to certain questions. So when Reno Bugeja asked about the referendum result, Muscat didn’t say, like his boss did, that this is water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. He said, “If it’s a question of whether partnership won or lost, then given what happened in the general election that followed, membership won.”\\nYet this is still double-speak and I don’t know why people are getting over-excited about it and why The Times ran a story headlined ‘Muscat admits Yes vote won in referendum.” Muscat did no such thing. Like his boss and every other party spokesperson before him, he factored in the general election result. A referendum result is a stand-alone. You do not wait to see the result of a general election that comes afterwards to interpret a referendum, nor do you allow five whole years and another general election defeat to go by before you can rip the words from your lips – and still you can’t do so without saying “given the general election result”.\\nYou see, that’s another trick Muscat has learned from his boss: how to appear to be telling people what they want to hear, without actually doing so, like promising to remove VAT without continuing the sentence and saying “but I’ll replace it with something else”. With this kind of person, you have to be on your guard and with your wits about you all the time, and that’s why I’ve been saying that I don’t trust him. Like his boss, he’s not straightforward, but strikes me as somebody for whom it’s all grist to the mill as long as it gets him what he wants.\\nIn that piece in The Times, he was described as “a high-ranking MLP official”. I’m sorry to have to be a nit-picker here, but since when is an ordinary MEP a high-ranking party official? Or is high-ranking being confused with ‘important to the king’, in the same way that the king’s mistress or ‘widna’ used to be considered important in 16th century courts?\\nEven Muscat’s comments on divorce were an echo of Sant’s comments on the same subject: “We’ll start a discussion…free vote…yada…yada…yada…”. Yes, and pigs, chickens, peacocks and lions will fly – I don’t think. Well, peacocks do fly but Jason’s staying put.\\nThe same process was at work when Muscat was asked to comment about Jason’s pooh-poohing of George Abela on Xarabank. “I don’t agree with that,” Muscat said, bang on cue and flashing that relentless smirk that is beginning to come across as some kind of symptom of a nervous disorder. Ah, but here’s the question that needs to be asked: does he not agree with Jason’s opinion, or does he not agree with Jason expressing that opinion in public in a way that damages the Labour Party (and Jason, but who cares about that, eh?). And then, bang on cue again, he more or less clears up this mystery for me by saying, “The process not only has to be transparent but should also be seen to be as transparent as possible.”\\nComing from the candidate who has made his name as Sant’s poodle, and who is being widely touted as the anointed one, that’s a bit rich.\\nRoll on, 5 June, because this is beginning to seem like the dance of the seven veils.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nMaltastar.com, the Labour Party’s ‘news’ portal set up by none other than Malta’s future prime minister, Dr Joseph Muscat PhD in Management Research (University of Bristol), last Tuesday carried this ‘anonymous letter’ in favour of guess-who, and against all those who would ‘turn the Pope into Satan’.\\n\\nThey would turn the Pope into a Satan\\n[email\\xa0protected]\\nTue, 08 April 2008\\n‘Hopeful’ wrote:\\nThe ink on the contents of The Sunday Times interview with Joseph Muscat had barely dried when those who through ignorance, self interest, and the prejudiced view Labour as the plague of Malta, came out with vengeance against him.\\nThe comments posted on The Sunday Times’ website barely a few hours after the interview was printed, shows that the even if Labour would propose the Pope as its leader, the Nationalists will turn him or her into a Satan from day one.\\nWitness the viciousness, the hatred, the vehemence and bitterness of these contributors.\\nHalf the population of Malta still supports the Labour Party despite the enormous advantages the Governing Party had, despite the dirty tricks, the scaremongering tactics, and the hatred churned out against Alfred Sant.\\nI would also add that given the present political scenario, the Prime Minister and ministers should consult the Opposition before appointing chairpersons and key persons in the administration. Only than we would believe that this is a government for the people.\\nIt kind of sums up the ingrained attitude which dictates that ‘all those who are not with us are against us’. We would turn the pope into Satan, eh? Some pope that is – though I have no doubt that had Joseph Muscat been born around AD1400 he would have latched himself onto some besotted cardinal’s frock-hem and ended up as Pope Poodle the First.\\nThe Joseph Muscat campaigner who wrote that letter – I’m not going to suggest that it was Muscat himself, and twins Etoile and Soleil can’t yet use a keyboard (though prodigies breed prodigies) – overlooks the fact that every leadership contender is being run down as rubbish for the very good reason that they are rubbish. All except George Abela, that is, who isn’t rubbish at all – and that is why the people who are rubbishing the other contenders are not rubbishing him too.\\nThe prospect of George Abela as prime minister does not send us running for the hills, like every one of the three Labour leaders in living memory did. Joseph Muscat? Run for the hills and take your Valium with you. Michael Falzon? Run screaming for the hills. Anglu Farrugia? Forget the hills, just emigrate. Marie Louise Coleiro? Oh, please – not Labour’s secretary-general from the Karmenu years. Evarist Bartolo? You’re joking, right? George Abela? So what? He looks OK to us – but then anything that comes in the shape and form of the man we voted for this time round is going to look OK to us, obviously.\\nNot obvious to Labour die-hards, though – but then we know they’re thick as two planks, even the ones with dikris. After all, they kept right on voting for that circus act called Alfred Sant, even though things were going pretty well and they refused to see this. But there you go.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nTalk about being divorced from reality. If there are two issues that really don’t galvanise the public, they’re neutrality and Partnership for Peace. Neutrality has been reduced over the years to one of those Old Labour buzz-words that can’t even be defined by the people who mouth them in party clubs and bars. And Partnership for Peace only got people a little over-exercised way back in 1996 when Alfred Sant – who it turns out hasn’t really resigned at all but will be back as leader of the opposition on 10 May when parliament reconvenes – spent the better part of an electoral campaign banging on about it. His electors didn’t look at the details or even the general gist. They just heard our friend Sant rabble-rouse about how the Sons of Malta would be sent to do battle in foreign lands far away from their mothers’ minestra and washing-machine, only to be returned in black body-bags, and that was it.\\nDoes anyone give a flying wotsit about Partnership for Peace now? Not at all – the only people I can see getting agitated about it are Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici (yes, he’s still around like Darth Vader Mark I) and the Graffiti Movement. Even the Labour Party’s acting leader Charles Mangion, who is about to find himself in an ambiguous position when the Irrevocably Resigned leader comes out of his burrow to lead the Opposition, was quite measured in his words about neutrality.\\nThat didn’t go down well with the worst prime minister in the entire history of Malta, who said that politicians who say the Constitution should be changed, in respect of neutrality, should specify their reasons and say the truth. I don’t know what he’s worried about, quite frankly, given that the Constitution can be changed only with a two-thirds vote in parliament. It looks like KMB’s a great respecter of the rules when he wants to be.\\nInstead of getting yet another buzz-cut, why doesn’t he buzz off for good and leave us alone? We’re a little tired of having him return to haunt us at regular intervals when we thought we’d buried him politically 21 years ago. All these people clinging to the cliff-face of public life decades after they have been discredited….it’s unbelievable. I filched a book off one of my sons yesterday, about the transition from authoritarian rule to democracy in southern Europe, and how people continue to accept politicians like this in the transitional stage. Given that we’re pretty new to democracy, maybe that’s what the problem is. I can’t see people like Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and Anglu Farrugia being given air-time for the serious discussion of their views in England, except in a George Galloway role.\\nThe reason that the Labour Party can’t continue flogging this dead-for-a-decade horse (like that other dead horse called Mistra) is not because the party is in tatters with a leader who says he resigned but is coming back to spook us on 10 May. It’s because people don’t care, full stop. It may come as a surprise to political parties on either side of the political fence, but they are not the ones who set the agenda.\\nPeople don’t suddenly start caring about something because it is important to the political parties. Some weeks ago, a business-cum-lawyer friend who spends his days and evenings circulating among the same tight crowd of movers and shakers and ‘important people’ was all upset because, he said, ‘everyone is scandalised about the Mistra case and thinks that Pullicino Orlando should resign, so why are you saying that he shouldn’t?’ I told him not to make the mistake of thinking that the Valletta crowd is ‘everyone’, and that in the much wider and very different circles I move in, nobody even mentions the subject, except rarely, and then only in passing and to crack a joke. I tend to guard carefully my ability to pick up general opinion, and in this case I was interested to see that the results of Malta Today’s survey on the subject, published last Sunday, tallied with my own understanding of how the situation is seen.\\nThough Malta Today attempted to work itself up into a scandalised rage, the fact of the matter is that well below 50 per cent of respondents from both sides of the political spectrum taken together think that Pullicino Orlando should resign, and a good chunk of those think that he should do so only if found guilty of corruption – which he won’t be, given that making telephone calls can’t be classified by any stretch of the imagination as corruption.\\nWhat I did find quite amusing is that some people who claimed to vote PN said Yes when asked whether they thought the Nationalist Party should kick him out. They are among those who haven’t yet grasped the niceties of parliamentary democracy, among which is the obvious fact that if the party kicks you out, you get to keep your seat and the party loses it. And hence that other fact that Niccolo Macchiavelli would have had no trouble discerning: that Pullicino Orlando, far from being the weakest MP is actually the one in the strongest position. And that’s why some people in the Nationalist Party would rather he left; it has only partly to do with the case itself.\\nSo back to my original argument that the general public couldn’t give a euro-cent about all this, just as they didn’t give a euro-cent about Charles Mangion and Karmenu Vella and their flats for rent. If it doesn’t catch the imagination, you can forget it. The spectacle of Pullicino Orlando chasing Darth Vader round Malta and shouting at him in a studio while brandishing a press card caught the public imagination. The thought of him collaring MEPA officials just didn’t. I’m not passing a value judgement here; I’m just pointing out facts that are obvious to me because of the nature of my work.\\nPartnership for Peace? Deadly dull and boring. I had to pop down the road from the office for a nice sardine salad and glass of dry white before I could sit down and work up the enthusiasm to even key in the words, still less think about the subject. And since I can’t be enthused to think about it even now, I can’t tell you what I think – but given that for the last couple of decades I have operated on the principle that anything I find boring my readers do too, that doesn’t really matter.\\nIf the soldiers like Partnership for Peace and think that it will open up their horizons beyond searching people at road-blocks and guarding concentration camps for illegal immigrants, then that’s fine by me. The only part of the debate – such as it is – that sparked the slightest bit of interest in me was Reno Bugeja’s question to my favourite government minister Tonio Borg (at least he’s given the foetuses a rest) on TVM’s Dissett a couple of weeks ago. Minister Borg explained – no doubt seeking to mitigate the fears of anxious mothers worried about body-bags and minestra going to waste – that Maltese soldiers will volunteer for overseas missions and will not be sent ‘against their will’.\\nI exploded with laughter there on my sofa, shouting out loud with great merriment that the Maltese army must be the only one in the world in which soldiers are asked whether they would like to be sent somewhere or not (ghax inkella tmur il-mami tiggieled mal-kurunell). And Bugeja took the words right out of my mouth by asking Borg precisely the same thing.\\nSadly, the sound of my barely controllable laughter allowed me to catch only a part of the reply: the part in which Borg looked surprised and wrong-footed at this unexpected come-back from his interviewer, given that he probably thinks asking soldiers whether they want to go or stay is a normal part of army discipline and, more importantly, politically and strategically a good thing. I just think that it serves as an important reminder of just what a bunch of spoilt brats we really are. God forbid I should point out to Tonio Borg that if you join the army, you take orders. And then they say that the Italian army is Europe’s joke. They haven’t met ours yet.\\nAnd here’s my favourite quote of the week, from an article in The Times last Wednesday about Labour’s leadership contenders and their views about who won the referendum:\\nA few months back, another leadership contender, Evarist Bartolo, had also made comments in this sense but his were in reply to the questions of a puppet on a satirical show.\\nOh please stop. You’re killing me.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nSome sexy chicks from Kurt Farrugia of Maltastar.com\\nEver since it started out, the Labour Party’s web portal Maltastar.com has used sex to pull in the hits: sex for men, that is, and not sex for women. The only time that George Clooney, who exerts a mesmeric influence on practically every woman on the planet, got a look-in was this week – and that was just an excuse to use naked photographs of his girlfriend in the doggy position.\\nNow watch the stampede to Maltastar.com. OK, are you back now? Over the years, the Labour Party’s obsession with sex and naked women on its ‘news’ website has become progressively worse. All it tells us is that (1) the website is run exclusively by men, (2) that they seem to be interested in attracting only men, (3) that they can’t get any themselves, so their fantasies are taking off at fresh tangents and, (4) that the Labour Party is as crass and vulgar as it ever was. I mean, how do you put yourself forward as the alternative government by showing naked women spread-eagled in sad men’s favourite ‘I’m going to dominate this chick’ positions? It’s just not respectable (but then Labour never was).\\nNotable ‘news items’ from Labour’s ‘news’ website in the last few weeks include the flight attendant who performed a strip show for the pilot and co-pilot in the – sorry, there’s no substitute for this word – cock-pit. That was decorated with lots of lovely shots of her magnificent breasts squashed at a camera lens. I wonder if Jason Micallef had a good hard look to examine her for signs for surgery. Maybe he would be kind enough to let me know whether mine are nicer.\\nThen there was George Clooney’s girlfriend sprawled doggy-fashion in a G-string, bum in the air, licking something on the ground. Can you believe it? On the website of the political party that wants to form the government. I really don’t want to picture Kurt Farrugia, the toby-jug-shaped-and-sized prat (the party is full of them) having a go over that one, but the image springs – horrors – unbidden to mind.\\nWhen the dog bites! When the bee stings! Lalalala! I just remember my favourite things! Lalalalalala! Thank you, Julie Andrews – the image is gone now…..only to be replaced by another naked bottom in a string. So Jason, has she had hers done, do you think?\\nAnd then there was Tuesday’s sensational headline news that ‘Redhead women have more sex’. Really? Three of my best friends at school had red hair by some amazing coincidence. I must give them a ring and check this one out. Or maybe I’ll give their numbers to Kurt Farrugia and he can do some in-depth investigation himself (sorry, girls – I’ll make this up to you, I promise).\\nAnd by the way, Kurt – the word you were looking for is ‘redheaded’. That’s the adjective; ‘redhead’ is the noun. A redhead is a person with red hair, of either sex – or maybe I should say gender instead, to calm your nerves. This Christmas, I’ll buy you a Pirelli calendar. That should keep you busy for hours.\\n  \\n\\n\\nChicks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 9th, 2008 at 9:14 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nYou’ll find Arnold in the pot of gold at the end of the Rainbow Left\\nHaving failed to convince us that he would make a superb MP to hold the country hostage, Arnold Cassola was back in Italy for some time, hawking his wares around the Italian electorate.\\nHe found a coalition grouping to take him in: the Rainbow Left, or Sinistra Arcobaleno. It sounds right up his street. Ivan Camilleri in Brussels, writing for The Times, got him on the fact that this grouping campaigned for wider access to abortion. Cassola told him that this makes no difference to the price of eggs (my phrase) given that abortion has been legal in Italy for three decades, and that the issue was decided by the people in a referendum.\\nAnd he’s right. You can’t exactly campaign on an anti-abortion ticket in a country where abortion is legal. Where I’m not square with him is when he says that he’s not uncomfortable with the idea of contesting under that particular banner.\\nThen in the same breath, he says:\\n“I repeat that I am against abortion and I have a different manifesto addressing issues related to my constituency – Italians who are living outside Italy. I am in this coalition just because of the way the Italian electoral law is at present. I am contesting as a candidate of the Italian Greens who are together with other parties in Sinistra Arcobaleno.”\\nCassola claims that he will vote against extending abortion rights if it comes to that. Well, we all know that this man likes to have his cake and eat it too. I would have more respect for someone with the guts to say, ‘Yes, I’m standing for election under this ticket and I don’t give a stuff what you in Malta think about abortion because this is Italy and for the time being I am Italian.’\\nBut no. He campaigned in Italy, where people have no problems with abortion and where abortion is legal (in fact, it’s where most Maltese have theirs, other than London), while at the same time keeping the Maltese electorate happy by remote control, for when he pops back to Malta again next year and becomes Maltese long enough to contest the MEP elections.\\nI think that this man’s natural home is in the Labour Party.\\n  \\n\\n\\nRainbow over the suburbs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 9th, 2008 at 9:27 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nEverybody is speaking about whether candidate X, Y or Z would make a suitable leader for the Labour Party. Sorry, Norman Hamilton, but it’s the topic du jour. Yet in the discussions of their various attributes, nobody seems to be asking the single most vital question. Are candidates X, Y or Z natural leaders or natural followers? You don’t become a leader simply by being elected to the leadership. You’ve got to have what it takes to lead. Those are qualities you are born with, and which are nurtured or weakened during one’s progress through life. They are not qualities that can be learned.\\nYes, there’s grooming to be done – the most notable results in our experience being with Gonzi and Fenech Adami. But those who groom must have the right raw material to work with. You can be taught the methods of leadership, but these alone will not make you a leader. Similarly, those born without the gift of creativity can be taught how to draw through repeated practice of technique, yet they will never make inspired and inspirational painters.\\nSome people are scathing because the Labour Party calls its top man ‘the leader’. It puts them in mind of simple-minded people who need to be led, usually by the nose. In this, they are wrong. In English political terminology, ‘leader’ is the correct term and ‘head’ is clumsy and incorrect. Schools have heads. Political parties have leaders. The Labour Party, for all its escalating hostility towards Britain and the British in the second half of the 20th century, has referenced – historically, at least – British politics. The official party name is resolutely Anglophone, and like Britain’s Labour Party, Conservative Party and Liberal Party, it has a leader rather than a head. The Nationalist Party, on the other hand, has historically been far, far more anti-British than the Labour Party was under Mintoff – just rather more polite and subtle about it. The party’s historical main influence (obviously, and to people like me, off-puttingly) was Italy, and so the Nationalist Party has a ‘capo’ or ‘kap’, which absolutely doesn’t work when translated into English. The political parties of the Anglophone world have leaders.\\nThey have leaders because the individuals in question are there to do precisely that: lead. This seems to me to be the single most overlooked factor in the current debate. Are we talking about whether Joseph Muscat, Michael Falzon, Evarist Bartolo and Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca are natural-born leaders? No, we are not. Instead, we are talking about their track record, their university degrees, their work as MEP/deputy leader/secretary-general/failed Minister of Education, and their 15-year projects drawn up in 10 days. This is all just so much useless hogwash. If you’re interviewed for any top corporate post, it’s not just your track record, your wishes and your plans that will be taken into account, but your personality and your leadership skills. If you’re one of life’s nodding-dogs and people-pleasers, you’ll never rise higher than middle management, if that. This is because nodding-dogs and people-pleasers are not leaders.\\nWe shouldn’t be looking at Joseph Muscat’s academic qualifications or his track record as an MEP. Those are about as relevant for the post of party leader and future prime minister as minced beef and tomato sauce are to the making of a raisin cake. We should instead be trying to picture him inspiring television and radio audiences, or crowds of 50,000 at the Granaries, at mass meetings which are in turn broadcast to even greater numbers. We should try to imagine him giving a rousing speech, which sounds as though it is coming straight from the heart and with conviction. We should picture him instilling confidence and trust in Labour Party delegates, members and electors. We should whip up a mental image of him inspiring zeal in those people, in the way that Lawrence Gonzi inspired zeal in his. We should try to visualise Muscat having a ‘difference of opinion’ with other party officials. Will they respect him, or will they undermine him? Will he lead with conviction or will he (1) try to please everyone, (2) throw a tantrum and stamp his feet, or (3) smile and then stick the knife in?\\nDoes he have what it takes to gather people behind him, or will they crowd behind him semi-reluctantly, dragging their feet, ‘for the good of the party’, daggers at the ready? Try as I might, I can’t imagine Muscat in the role of an inspiring leader. He is one of life’s nodding-dogs, one of those irritating people who you find in practically every office, sucking up to the boss and currying favour, and in most classrooms, actively working for the title of teacher’s pet.\\nThe same can be said for the other three: Falzon, Coleiro Preca and Bartolo are more nodding-dogs. They’d make excellent adornments for your rear-view mirror, if you like that kind of thing. Falzon has nodded his way through the last 16 years, and nodded right through this last electoral campaign. Bartolo has nodded so hard that I’m surprised his head hasn’t come off (maybe it’s on springs, like that toy puppy I had as a child). His many deficiencies, inconsistencies and attempts at staying on the right side of the party line lest something bad happen to him were highlighted superbly by means of clips from years-old broadcasts on TVM’s Dissett, the day before yesterday. I don’t think anyone watching that show, unless he is politically blind or a blood relation, would have thought: “Wow, that’s what I call leadership. Go for it, Ev!”\\nMarie-Louise Coleiro Preca? Forget it. Her performance on that same edition of Dissett was a fatally defining moment. She repeated word for word the script of an interview she gave to The Sunday Times – literally, word for word. She must have rehearsed it lest she fluff her lines, and then trotted it out twice. Did she imagine that people who read The Sunday Times don’t also watch Dissett? Unbelievably, she repeated once more her assertion that the Labour Party wasn’t responsible for the violence of the years when she was secretary-general. The party didn’t commission the thugs, it didn’t shelter them, and it didn’t organise them, and she would have been the first to resign if the party had anything to do with them. This is like saying that Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party had nothing to do with the violence perpetrated against Jewish shopkeepers by their neighbours in the late 1930s. Of course they did.\\nLet me explain this to Mrs Coleiro Preca very carefully and in simple language. The Labour Party might not have placed advertisements in the Situations Vacant columns of the newspapers, calling for thugs and violent hit-men, but it created the conditions in which that kind of violence grew and in which the violent flourished. More to the point, the violent were not arrested, reprimanded or prosecuted. Their victims were.\\nLet me explain something even more carefully to Mrs Coleiro Preca, who imagines that she has leadership qualities when she couldn’t even assess the situation around her in 1984, or interpret it correctly. When one of my friends (a woman, if you please) was beaten up so savagely that she spent weeks in bed unable to move, the men who did it emerged from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was then exactly where it is now. She can’t deny this because I saw them there just a few seconds before they rushed at us. They were chatting to the Foreign Minister. The same men also came after me, despite the fact that I was vastly pregnant at the time, but I was rescued by clerks at the post office across the road from the ministry, where the Malta Tourism Authority is now housed. They slammed the post office doors shut while the men who emerged from the Ministry tried to ram them down.\\nThat’s just one incident. I’m not going to describe to Mrs Coleiro Preca the many times that unarmed protesters were attacked by policemen for whom the Labour government was definitely responsible. Just one anecdote will suffice, I think. On the same spot where a year later I would be rescued by post office workers, I sheltered in the doorway of an empty house (my grandparents’ house, as it happened) and sobbed in fear and disbelief as I watched a policeman, who had spittle foaming up around his mouth, smash every window and windscreen of every car parked on that stretch of Melita Street between Merchant Street and St Paul Street and, when he had finished, climb up onto them and jump up and down on their roofs, causing them to collapse and dent. All the while he was shouting (madly, might I add) political slogans in favour of the Labour Party.\\nSure, Mrs Coleiro Preca personally didn’t hire him or organise him, but so what? She was secretary-general of the political party that formed the government, the people who were responsible for the police force. The occasion was the archbishop’s meeting in St John’s Square at the height of the church schools’ crisis. There was an open-air mass, attended by whole families and young children, and a speech. Afterwards, parts of the crowd – families, not militant students – moved up Merchants Street and were met by a line of armed police. The order to charge was given, and the next thing I knew there were children screaming, pushchairs being flung about, hysterical parents running all over the place, and those mad thugs in uniform chasing everyone, and I ended up in that doorway watching a mad policeman thrashing cars like he was high on cocaine. Can Mrs Coleiro Preca talk her way out of that one?\\n\\nAlfred Sant was a miserable failure as a party leader for a variety of reasons, but chief among them – the most fundamental reason – was the fact that he has no leadership qualities to speak of. His predecessor had no leadership qualities either (and still doesn’t). Mintoff, love him or despise him – and I belong in the latter category – was a natural-born leader and that is why he was able to get away with all that he got away with, to the detriment of the country and its people. If you are a natural-born leader you can even get away with mass murder, as Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Chairman Mao did. They were cruel people, but born leaders. Natural-born leaders do not always have the right ideas and are not necessarily a good thing for those they lead. Sometimes, they can be a force for evil. But this does not mean that you don’t have to be a leader to lead. You do have to be a leader. Otherwise, you just can’t swing it.\\nOnly one of the Labour Party’s leadership candidates manifests the psychological qualities of leadership, and this emerged clearly in an interview with The Sunday Times last Sunday. I’d better not mention his name lest I be accused once more of having a hidden agenda in trying to sabotage his chances by being perceived as favouring him. Apparently, Labour Party delegates reason in a convoluted manner that is beyond my comprehension. My accusers said that if I want to see George Abela elected and Joseph Muscat flushed away, then I should criticise the former and praise the latter. But the words would just stick in my throat.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nMy growing conviction that the Labour Party is peopled with characters straight out of The Fast Show is given further encouragement by recent sightings of Anglu Farrugia, who is now modelling himself on Swiss Toni. Take a close look at this photograph, which was carried in The Times yesterday.\\n\\nNow take a good look at Swiss Toni.\\n\\nAnglu will have seen Swiss Toni on BBC Prime, but because he has no sense of humour and is one of those literal people, the fact that the show was a satirical comedy about a used-car salesman will have escaped him. Instead, he will have seen a rather smart chap in sharp clothes who fashions his hair fetchingly and has a look about him that means business.\\nSo what was that gathering, to which our Anglu went disguised as Swiss Toni? It was a commemoration of an 87th anniversary. Yes, that’s right – 87th. Not 80th, not 90th, but 87th – you will agree that this is the kind of diamond round number that just calls for the wreaths to be broken out and the photographers to be called in. Ah, but when you’re desperate, you’re desperate. Needs must when the devil drives, as I like to say, so casting around for 87th anniversaries to which reporters may be summoned to witness the spectacle of Anglu Farrugia turning up as Swiss Toni can’t be ruled out on grounds of fatuousness.\\nAnd this wasn’t just any old 87th anniversary, either. It was the 87th anniversary of the death of Manwel Dimech. Charles Mangion, the tattered political party’s ‘acting leader’ (who is acting only until Alfred Sant swings back into parliament as leader of the Opposition on 10 May) told the assembled clutch of reporters that Dimech had “battled for freedom of expression and freedom of thought”. That’s right. Manwel Dimech fought his battles, and a century later we have Charlie Mangion, free to tell his crowds that those who don’t see eye-to-eye with him have a different DNA structure. Thus are the mighty battles reduced to farce.\\nDisplaying a commendable sense of irony and historical insight, the acting leader of the political party that destroyed freedom of expression in Malta during its 16 years in government went on to say that people should not now be sidelined for exercising the freedom of thought and expression that Manwel Dimech had fought for. Meanwhile, Anglu Farrugia hoped to impress us by striking his best Swiss Toni pose.\\nThe Maltese have achieved the rights of freedom of thought and of expression, Mangion banged on. Ah, yes – but when was that exactly? It wasn’t in Manwel Dimech’s time or thanks to Manwel Dimech’s efforts. And it certainly wasn’t in the years 1971-1986, which saw the burning down of a newspaper building, the ransacking of the house of the leader of the Opposition, the pillaging of party clubs, the monopolization of the broadcast media by the Labour Party, and the physical assault of peaceful protesters, while everyone who did not subscribe to the Labour dream was terrorized into silence.\\nThe magic number is 87, but it has nothing to do with the anniversary of Manwel Dimech’s death.\\nAnd while we’re about it, I’m going to quote the final sentence of that report in The Times.\\nDr Mangion laid flowers at the foot of the Manwel Dimech monument, followed by deputy leader Michael Falzon and the party’s sections.\\nWhat a wonderful sentence. The party’s sections? What might those be, and how do they set about trailing after Michael Falzon and laying flowers at the feet of monuments?\\nAs Swiss Toni might have said, running the Labour Party is like making love to a beautiful woman. First you get Michael Falzon and the flowers out of the way and then you deal with the sections.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 9:00 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSwiss Toni, a used-car salesman and well-known character in British comic satire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 9:00 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Labour MP Helena Dalli has had an article called ‘141,888 imweġġgħin’ published in L-orizzont.\\nYou will deduce that the 141,888 in question are the people who voted Labour in this last election. I ask myself why they could possibly be hurt, given that you only get a voting document when you are over 18, and grown-ups are supposed to understand that they must cope with the consequences of their actions rather than blaming others.\\nVoting Labour when Labour is clearly unfit to govern, and when the party is still led by serial loser Alfred Sant is something that you do to yourself (and to the country) and not something that is done to you.\\nI struggle past the strange characters of the incompatible Maltese font on the L-orizzont website, which makes reading an exercise in deciphering a code, and discover that Helena is cross because Labour politicians are now seeking to dissociate themselves from policies and methods that they think might have led to their electoral downfall.\\nShe wants to know why they didn’t speak out before if this is what they were thinking. Oh, I imagine that would have something to do with the culture of nodding to the sound of His Master’s Voice, and the fear of voicing dissent lest they be cast out into the wilderness by the Board of Vigilance and Discipline. My observation is that there wasn’t much of a discussion thing going on up at Labour HQ.\\nAnd sure enough, here’s Helena, in translation because of that nuisance font.\\nThose who persist in disagreeing with the dominant opinion in the party, and who fail to convince with their own views, would do best to leave the party. There were instances where this happened, and that makes for personal credibility.\\nI agree that it makes for greater credibility. I agree that those who disagreed and departed are taken far more seriously by all but those with a closed partisan mentality, while the nodding dogs tend to be despised. I agree that those who carried on nodding while silently disagreeing are not worth a cent and cannot be considered to have backbone or leadership qualities.\\nBut I don’t agree with this ‘all or nothing’ approach that takes such an extreme view of policy-building. With its high drama and its far-out positions, it is not just electors that the Labour Party has been forcing into a corner, but also its own officials and key people.\\nMrs Dalli says that silence is preferable to washing the party’s dirty laundry in public. How wrong she is. Silence is a killer. It’s not golden, but a cancerous tumour that eats away from within, as anyone who wakes up to find that his perfect spouse has run out on their perfect marriage tends to discover. A party the size of the Labour Party has to learn how to do what the Nationalist Party has been doing for years. It has to learn how to handle criticism in public forums by its prominent and less prominent politicians and past and present members of the executive. That makes for strength. Fostering a seething and resentful silence makes for weakness. But we have already seen that.\\nMrs Dalli’s argument that the sight and sound of Labour politicians bickering about what went wrong continues to heap further hurt on the 141,888 people who voted for them is misplaced. That hurt is not the result of bickering, but the feeling of being let down and cheated by a party that promised a sweeping victory and red flags at Castile Palace. Now these electors realise that their chosen party had no hard-and-fast surveys to back up their optimism, no proper campaign strategy, and no real policies. It’s come as a bit of a shock.\\nMrs Dalli was spot on when she said that those who went along with the party’s policies before the election, because they were convinced of victory, and who are now distancing themselves from those policies because they lost, are rendering themselves ridiculous. It’s one thing admitting that you were mistaken and that you regret this. It’s another thing going all out to pretend that you had nothing to do with it. Those who want to turn themselves into a political sideshow, she wrote, belong in a circus. And those who are seeking an even higher position in the party after having failed so miserably in a lower one are beyond belief. I agree with her there, too. Imagine making a mess of the job of deputy leader and then putting yourself forward for consideration as leader. It’s incredible. Or having skated into the party as Alfred Sant’s pocket-dog and then claiming that you represent a new vision for Labour – well, that’s incredible, too.\\n  \\n\\n\\nHMV\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 11:34 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nI feel a sensation of shock that Carmel Cacopardo did not do better.\\nCasting about for reasons to survive into the second quarter of the 21st century, Harry Vassallo has blamed the Nationalist Party for his party’s poor performance at the polls last month.\\nI suppose the Nationalist Party was also responsible in 1992, 1996, 1998 and 2003. And if you’re looking for the reason why Walter Veltroni’s Rainbow Left coalition failed at the Italian polls last Sunday, leaving Arnold Cassola without his much-coveted Italian parliamentary pension, then you can blame the Nationalist Party for that, too.\\nWhen things go wrong for Harry and his cohorts, it’s always the Nationalist Party’s fault. The Nationalist Party failed to fill in his VAT returns, failed to organise the presidential pardon he demanded and is now failing to send him to prison while he stills fails to pay his fines.\\nSod it all, the man is actually going to get away with it. He’s not going to pay his fine and he’s not going to prison either – because he’s Harry Vassallo. Now imagine what the Hodor would do if it were a Labour or Nationalist politician in Harry’s position, let alone the party leaders.\\nHarry told The Malta Independent:\\n“The other two parties successfully reduced the campaign to a single issue: Choosing whether Lawrence Gonzi or Alfred Sant should be Prime Minister. The Greens could have nothing to say on this issue: To take sides would deny our reason for being. The PN successfully created a national panic casting the Greens as a threat.” \\nWell, of course the campaign was about choosing the best man for prime minister. What else could it possibly be about? In his determination to carry on with AD’s MLPN fiction, Harry failed to observe that this strategy was used only by the Nationalist Party. The Labour Party did the opposite of what Harry claims, and actually did its best to hide the fact of Alfred Sant, bringing him out only on special occasions and hoping that he would keep his trap shut.\\nThe Greens. The Greens. The Greens. Since when is Alternattiva Demokratika ‘The Greens’? The only greens I see here are the ones in my lose-weight-now salad, and there isn’t a leaf among them that bears even the faintest resemblance to Harry, Arnold or that man with the spectacular eyebrows. I suppose they imagine that calling themselves The Greens sounds what would have been called, in my mother’s day (and probably even theirs) ‘trendy’ and ‘with it’. Well, they’re just in time for the third round of flares and platform shoes.\\nHere’s Dr-Divorced-From-Reality again:\\n“There is a sensation of shock that Carmel Cacopardo did not do better while Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando was elected in two districts.”\\nWho’s shocked? These people can’t possibly have truly believed that Carmel Cacopardo would be elected sparat. He probably wouldn’t even have been elected had he stood under the Nationalist Party ticket.\\nAnd just listen to this self-deluded reasoning:\\n“The result is disappointing but we went from 0.7 per cent in 2003 to 9.3 per cent in 2004.”\\nThere goes Harry, comparing apples with pears again. AD (not ‘The Greens’) did not go from 0.7 per cent to 9.3%. The party’s performance in general elections has been more or less static since 1992. The 2004 poll was for the selection of MEPs, not MPs, and it’s a fairly safe bet that when (not if) Cassola tries the same trick next year he’s going to be nowhere near as successful. People don’t have much truck with candidates who hawk their wares unconvincingly from one country to another. It looks a bit self-seeking. But Harry thinks otherwise:\\n“Perhaps in 2009 it will be time for us to be given the support we need to begin doing something about it.”\\nPlease don’t tell me that Harry is going to put himself forward as an MEP candidate now.\\n  \\n\\n\\nI’m shocked\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 12:44 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nTo me it’s obvious that when choosing a new leader, the Labour Party should be canvassing opinion among those who don’t vote Labour and not among those who already do. To get into government it needs new buyers, people who haven’t been buying Labour recently or who have never done so at all. But I don’t think the Labour Party understands that political marketing is just like other forms of marketing. It’s about find new markets and customers for your product. It’s about finding out what people want and giving it to them. It’s not about keeping your existing customers happy. That’s called customer relationship management, and is something else altogether.\\nI was away for a few days, and when I got back I read an article by Alfred Mifsud in The Malta Independent of last Friday. It was about this very subject. Read this, for example.\\nThe PN branded their last election campaign as gonziPN not because Prime Minister Gonzi wants to build a cult in his honour. They did so because research among the electorate showed that while the party was suffering fatigue and dissatisfaction with its long stay in government, voters’ attitude was much mellower regarding Gonzi personally.\\nIf Labour failed to paste up huge pictures of Alfred Sant on their billboards it was not because they wanted to show disrespect to their leader. It was because their research showed that voters were much warmer to the party than they were to Alfred Sant personally who consistently, in all reliable research, scored less than Gonzi on the issues of credibility and appropriateness for the top job.\\nMifsud suggests that the Labour Party should use marketing research methods when choosing its new leader.\\nI dare suggest that unless Labour adheres to this principle when it makes the choice of the new leader, it could prejudice as of now its chances of winning the next election. The PN did not make that mistake when they chose Gonzi to take over from Fenech Adami. The party machinery, a common phrase these days, which is not easily definable but basically refers to those who really pull the strings behind major decisions, threw its weight behind Gonzi because they got market feedback that while Dalli could have been more popular with core PN supporters, Gonzi was more acceptable to the narrow middle segment of floating voters.\\nAlfred Mifsud doesn’t back Joseph Muscat. He backs George Abela. Now here’s the thing. Mifsud was Muscat’s boss twice over: at Super One when he was in charge and Muscat was the equivalent of Charlon Gouder, pursuing Fenech Adami and heckling him, and then again when he employed him at his investment advisory firm. So when Mifsud speaks about Muscat, we can assume that he knows exactly what he is saying.\\nThe Labour Party machinery is clearly backing the candidature of Joseph Muscat. Have they made any research showing that Joseph Muscat can offer better prospects for winning the next election than the other candidates? My impression is that while Joseph has great potential to reach the top post at some point in his career, he still needs to enrich his CV with executive experience and further doses of maturity before he would be able to successfully take Lawrence Gonzi head on sometime in the next five years. So I thought the Labour Party machinery must know something I don’t know, that my impression is wrong, and that they truly see Joseph Muscat as their best hope to win government next time round, an elusive objective if they ever had one.\\nMifsud decides to carry out some market research of his own. Because this is a field with which he is more than familiar, he commissioned a telephone survey of 400 respondents, chosen not at random but by age and location to give a representative sample of the electorate. A survey like this has a wide margin of error but it remains a good indication of how things stand.\\nI had picked up the same indications already by using my antennae, but because no one in the Labour Party is going to believe anyone’s antennae, still less mine, a survey is useful evidence.\\nThose who claimed to vote Labour or who refused to say how they voted in the last election (Mifsud took them to be Labour voters feeling routed and vulnerable, with which I tend to agree) all went for Joseph Muscat. Mifsud sees this as evidence that the party machinery has been successful in communicating the message that he is the chosen one. I think there are other reasons too, foremost among them being their inability to see what those who are on the outside and looking in can see very clearly indeed: that the man is worryingly shallow and self-satisfied, and that his smile is more of a disconcerting nervous twitch that doesn’t reach his eyes. These respondents said that they will vote Labour no matter which person is chosen as leader. So they are not new customers and Labour gains nothing by giving them their preferred candidate.\\nRespondents who consider themselves floating voters opted for George Abela. So did those who voted Nationalist. Because these two categories are the very ones that represent the new customers that Labour leads to get elected (there are another two categories, the new voters of 2013 and those who usually vote Labour but this time failed to vote), they are the ones to whom Labour should be listening. But we are the very ones who are being told to mind our own business and stay out of what the Labour Party considers to be a purely private and internal matter. If they tell us to butt out now, then of course we will have no choice but to butt them out in 2013. I hope they realise this.\\nAlfred Mifsud concludes that the Labour Party is actually telling its potential new customers:\\n…that they do not care about their tastes, feelings or expectations and want to continue with the trial and error methodology, based on hope rather than logic. Small wonder that if this persists, Labour could be forcing floating voters as of now to vote it yet again into opposition right until 2018. \\nYes, I see the situation the same way, but it is even more worrying than that. If the Labour Party doesn’t even know how to choose a suitable leader, how can it be relied upon to develop policy and run the country?\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nMy Silvio left me for the youth vote\\nIt looks like Silvio’s old ladies are dying on him by degrees. It’s true that as one old lady kicks the bucket another one comes on stream, but Silvio is taking no chances. He has written an article for The Malta Independent (oh my god, I have competition) called ‘Attracting the younger generation’, in which he displays his analytical skills and reveals himself to be the true strategist that Labour needs.\\nOne of the conclusions that one can make regarding the last general election is that the younger generation played a very important part in it. I am personally convinced that the majority of youths wanted an alternative to the Nationalist government, but on the other hand the Labour Party was not convincing enough for them.\\nI don’t know where Silvio spent the electoral campaign, apart from handing out plastic roses at school gates and sucking up to old ladies, but from where I was sitting, it looked like the ‘majority of youths’ were at Nationalist mass meetings screaming ‘Gonzi’.\\nAnd while we’re about it, will you excuse me for delivering a mini hectoring lecture about the use of the words ‘youth’ and ‘youths’? Every time I see the way they are deployed like missiles in articles by politicians and other people with an agenda, I want to fling myself down and gnaw the carpet.\\nThe word ‘youth’ has several meanings, and one of them is ‘young people’, as in ‘the youth of the country’. (The youth of the country does not mean an 18-year-old peasant from Rahal Gandab; it means all the young people of the country, as in state). So please would all you politicians just stop writing and talking about ‘the youths of Malta’ because that has another meaning entirely. It means the young men of Malta, and not young Maltese people of both genders.\\nTheoretically, the words ‘youth’ (when used to indicate one person rather than young people collectively) and ‘youths’ can be used to mean young women. In reality, among native speakers of English they never are. Even the words themselves are going the way of ‘bloomers’ and ‘perambulator’ and have long been substituted by the far more sensible ‘young people’. Say ‘youth’ and you immediately sound archaic. Say ‘youths’ when you mean ‘young people’, and you give yourself away as somebody who learned English badly as a second or even third language.\\nOK, hectoring lecture over and back to Silvio Parnis (but mind you slip on the Brylcreem). Here he is again:\\nTherefore, the main challenge that the Labour Party needs to work on is to attract as many young people as possible to the party. When I say young people, I don’t only mean the under 35s, but also the under 18s, who will be voting in five years’ time.\\nWell, our Silvio has come up with a new strategy for selling the Labour Party to those who don’t want to buy any (“just looking, thanks”). It’s called paedophile politics. Get them when they’re kids and groom them as Labour prey.\\nWhat happened to the Brigata Laburista, by the way? Maybe there isn’t time for it in between duttrina and private lessons. My god, no wonder so many Maltese adults are screwed up, having had their free time after school divided between political brainwashing, extra maths, and religious brainwashing. I’m so glad I escaped the lot. But back to brainy Silvio, who I’m told was once a duttrina teacher (“Issa, tfal, se naraw ghaliex Gesu Kristu ma kienx juza l-gel. Elfejn sena ilu kienu kellhom biss iz-zejt taz-zebbuga.”).\\nI have had worrying reports from various people where traditional Labourite families couldn’t convince their children to vote Labour, not because their children had any obligation to do so, but because even though their children knew we needed a change, the Labour Party was not convincing enough.\\nThat’s what happens when you give the children of the working-class a decent education. With a few notable exceptions, they stop voting Labour. Some people believe that this is due to embarrassment. They don’t want to carry on being associated with anything as cringe-making as the shambolic Labour Party and see it as tal-hamalli.\\nI don’t think that’s the reason. The way I see it is that a good, sound education and exposure to different ways of doing things gives young people (not youths) the analytical skills they need to see things clearly and make sound judgements. And that’s why they don’t vote Labour. To get hold of the votes of these people, Labour doesn’t need to become less embarrassing (though that, too). It needs to become discernibly capable of governing without fiasco.\\nIf the mountain won’t go to Mohammed, Mohammed will go to the mountain. Silvio Parnis has plans to stop young people escaping from Labour’s predatory claws.\\nThe Labour Party needs to start making its voice heard in various educational institutions and other places which are frequented by young people. The party needs to listen to what these youths are saying, analyse all the criticism it receives and ask them what plans they have for the future.\\nAs somebody with plenty of direct experience of ‘youths’, I can explain to Silvio that the persistent and creepy interest of ‘an old person’ (for which read anyone above the age of 26), and more so one who is dripping in hair-wax and keen to be thought of as hip or wicked (though he would say cool), is not going to persuade anyone to vote Labour. Both the boys and the girls will think of him as some kind of perv who is trying to pick them up. They will get a couple of drinks off him and then run off laughing.\\nAnd only somebody with no experience of ‘youths’ at all would classify people in their 30s as youth, unless they are themselves in their 30s and want to keep on thinking of themselves as young rather than on the outer cusp of middle age (desperate, desperate).\\nAnd what is Silvio proposing with his Labour infiltration of ‘educational establishments’? Maybe he thinks that it’s a good idea to send Labour ambassadors into the classroom to promote the Labour message of peace and love (“I’d like to buy the world a home and keep it company…grow apple trees and honey bees and snow-white turtle doves. It’s the real thing. Coca Cola is….”). Yes, sure – I can really see that working. “Ma, a strange man came to talk to us at school today. What’s a working class? Is it like a maths class? And his hair was really weird.”\\nNow here’s more of Silvio, back again with his youths.\\nIf we want to earn the trust of these youths, we also have to start appealing to the middle class. While the Labour Party still needs to take care of the working class and those who remain at the bottom of the social ladder, we also need to acknowledge those who have made a success of their life. These people need to feel comfortable going to the Labour Party, speaking to its members and at the end of the day even voting Labour.\\nWell, what can I say? If you’re working class, according to Mr Greaseball, you haven’t made a success of your life. You can see where this man is coming from: success = money (and a snazzy electric-blue two-seater convertible with a SIL number-plate). I hate to be nasty, but somebody should tell Silvio Parnis that no matter how much money he makes and how many old ladies he sucks up to, he’s going to stay working-class until the lid is nailed down on his coffin. And probably even after that, because I can just picture him getting some metallic spoilers for his heavenly wings and a couple of strategic zips for his heavenly frock, though where he will get hair-wax in the celestial hereafter is quite beyond me. Perhaps he can have a little dig around his ears.\\nSilvio isn’t letting us go without some more good advice for drumming up the youth vote.\\nThese youths should try to convince their friends and fellow youths who attend the same schools and places of entertainment, to look to the Labour Party for their future needs and aspirations.\\nYouths, youths, youths, youths….there I go, chewing the carpet again. By writing like this, Silvio reveals himself as somebody who has long left his youth behind him (which doesn’t mean that there’s a young man standing at his back). Any young person who tries to proselytize for politics or religion in the schoolyard will be classified as (1) a nerd, (2) nuts, (3) a perv, (4) the smelly bearer of dandruff, or (4) to be avoided at all costs. I wonder if that’s what happened to Silvio while he was growing up. That would explain a lot.\\n  \\n\\n\\nghonella\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 7:12 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nMaria l-Maws was on TVM last Tuesday night, being interviewed by Reno Bugeja. I don’t quite know why, but Maria l-Maws puts me in mind of a nun without a habit and wimple – not a priest, but a nun. It could have something to do with that deliberately low, monotonous, faux-gentle tone, which some nuns are excellent at using for the delivery of menacing words. It could be because if you were to wrap a wimple round his head he would pass muster as Sister Evarist, or Suor Bartolo. Anyway, when I look at him and hear him speak, all I can think of is nun, nun, nun and not mouse, mouse, mouse. But because his alter ego is Maria l-Maws, mouse it’s going to be.\\nReno showed Varist (or Ev, as he is known among tal-pepe circles) a video clip of a television broadcast he had made in the 2003 referendum campaign, asking Malta in that nun’s voice to vote No, not to vote, or to spoil the ballot-sheet. There he was, repeating the mantra of His Master’s Voice – a man who now wishes to be considered statesmanlike enough to be prime minister, telling the nation to scribble on the ballot-sheet while in the polling-booth. Does this happen anywhere else in the democratic world? I’m just wondering. It seems shameful to me, but Evarist made his request with such nun-like confidence that he almost convinced me of the normality of senior politicians telling people not to vote or to rip up or ruin their ballot-paper.\\nIl-parabboli ta’ Bartlu\\nReno said he would show him another video clip, and Varist replied: “Nista nimmagina liema.” Well, what do you know? It was one of those didactic ‘let’s make things simple for simple minds’ intimate chats he likes to have with television viewers, the assumption being that they all have a mental age of three and like to be spoken to in parables and metaphors a la Dom Mintoff.\\nIn this one, he was talking about the European Union and its regulations as a pair of one-size-fits-all shoes, which we have to wear whether they fit us or not. “Trid tilbes l-uniformi tal-EU, trid jew ma tridx,” he said. Any moment, and he might have brought out a couple of puppets on strings to give us a demo: a balena clearly marked with the letters E and U, and a makku sporting the George Cross. Suor Bartolo pulls the strings and the balena eats the makku while the children burst into tears.\\nThe weird thing is that, in the exchange of views which followed this clip, you could see Evarist getting all hot under the collar at the very thought of EU membership. Is he over it, or is he not over it? He’d better let us know. Reno asked him about U-turns and non-U turns and credibility, and Evarist tried to get out of his tight spot by putting on that attitude of outraged self-justification that he likes to adopt when he’s painted himself into a corner. He tried to compare the Labour Party’s shifting position on the EU to that of Britain’s Conservative Party. It just didn’t wash.\\n206 Laburisti in Haz-Zebbug didn’t vote\\nThen he let slip a bit of information that tells us how the big cheeses in the Labour Party know more than they are letting on about the Laburisti who didn’t vote in this last election. There were ‘mijiet’ in Haz-Zebbug alone, he said: 206, to be precise. I asked around the living-room to be sure that I had heard correctly. Two hundred and six? You mean, not 205 or 207, or about 200, but precisely 206? Where did that six come from?\\nIl-ggant tal-palazz\\nThen it was back to another video clip. By this time, I was looking forward to them for their amusement value. There Ev was again, speaking in parables:\\nIl-Partit Nazzjonalista qisu l-ggant tal-palazz. Libsulu werqa biex jghattu dak li hemm taht; werqa bl-istillel tal-Ewropa.\\nIl-ggant tal-palazz. They were all screaming with laughter on the sofa thinking he was speaking about the giant at the end of Jack’s beanstalk. Then somewhere from the dimmer recesses of my memory I retrieved the information that the large bronze of Andrea Doria that stands in the courtyard at the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta was known as il-ggant tal-palazz. Some puritanical governor or other had a fig-leaf soldered on to protect Doria-cum-Neptune’s modesty from the eyes of the ladies, or vice versa. Il-ggant tal-palazz – oh good grief.\\nUnilateral TV disarmament\\nThen Ev was on to the subject of television stations owned by political parties. He thinks there shouldn’t be any because they are a financial burden. Well, that’s a non sequitur if ever there was one. If the cost is crippling the Labour Party, then the Labour Party should give up Super One, but what we are speaking about here is something like the question of unilateral disarmament in the Cold War. I won’t do it unless you do it too. Neither of us will do it unless we are forced to do so. Soon, I expect, they will be holding bilateral meetings to ensure that each disarms when the other does so.\\nEvarist thinks that the money would be better spent in developing policies. I hate to break this to him, but to develop policies what you need is people with brains, not money saved on a television station.\\nL-ekonomisti tal-jukebox\\nTime for another clip, and we were treated to the sight and sound of Evarist speaking about l-ekonomisti tal-jukebox – sorry, gujkboks: titfa l-flus u ddoqqu d-diska li trid.\\nAnother clip, this time showing Evarist rounding on university professor Kenneth Wain with the words and gestures of a nun. I can’t quite put my finger on what it is, but he didn’t go on the attack like a man. “Missek tisthi!” Mouth takes on shape of pig’s rectum. “Imbasta professur tal-universita!” Mouth makes ‘pooh-ghalik’ gesture. “Ghax ma’ tmurx tara….” He sits with hands crossed across his knees, tut-tutting, pooh-poohing and x’gharukaza-ing, wearing the sort of scornful and contemptuous expression usually seen on old ladies watching a girl go by in skimpy shorts. You get the drift. Kenneth Wain was in the Yes Movement, and Evarist thought that we should vote No, not vote or spoil our ballot-sheet.\\nEvarist says that when you educate your children, they vote Nationalist\\nLike Silvio Parnis, he said he was concerned about the number of children of working-class Laburisti parents who are not voting Labour, because they feel it is beneath them. Iss hej, their parents make sacrifices to ensure they get a good education, and then off they go and vote Labour. Of course, what Evarist is really saying here, though I’m sure he didn’t mean it quite that way, is that when people are educated they start voting Nationalist. Ev did the opposite, of course. His Nationalist parents struggled to give him and his siblings a proper education, and then off went Ev to become a Laburist.\\nWow, he read Mao\\nReno Bugeja asked him about his youthful flirtation with Communism. Yes, he replied. I read the works of Mao, Lenin and Marx. Oh god, I said, there on my sofa. What next – Jonathan Livingston Seagull? Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance? The Little Prince? A Che Guevara T-shirt worn without irony? A Deep Purple Live LP? So 1974.\\nThen Ev began boasting about how the Labour Party had cleaned up its act post 1992, and how it had set up the Board of Vigilance and Discipline to keep things under control and to clear out corrupt and violent elements. And Reno reminded him that he was the chairman of that board when it took the decision to expel Wenzu Mintoff and Toni Abela – for speaking out against corrupt and violent elements in the party. Ah, but they were washing Labour’s dirty laundry in public, and that’s unforgivable. “Illum hbieb hafna,” Suor Bartolo said. Ar’hemm, hej – definitely not leadership material, but then neither was his friend Fred.\\n  \\n\\n\\nEvarist Bartolo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 10:57 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nListening to Marie Louise Coleiro Preca on Dissett last Tuesday, I had one of those ‘Alice Through the Looking-Glass’ moments where I begin to wonder whether the weirdness is really normality and I’m either nuts or have passed through the looking-glass into a parallel world.\\nThere she was, right on message, banging on about the way the Labour Party decided it would respect the verdict of the people in the 2003 general election. And I suddenly realised how, because the Labour Party has repeated this same mantra ad nauseam over the last five years as though it is somehow a legitimate statement, nobody has come forward to state the obvious.\\nThe Opposition party – or anybody else, for that matter – should not have to take a conscious decision to respect the will of the people in a general election. It should be a given.\\nAh, but Marie Louise went one step beyond that. With a serious expression and firm conviction, she said on television: “The Labour Party took a decision at its general conference (after the referendum in 2003) that it would respect the will of the people in the general election.”\\nWhat? Let me say that a little louder. WHAT? WHAT? How on earth do we sit there and listen while these appalling things are said so matter-of-factly? Marie Louise Coleiro Preca boasted – yes, she actually boasted – that the Labour Party’s general conference decided to respect the will of the people in a general election – but not, it was left unsaid but inferred, in a referendum. I honestly can’t understand how these people get away with saying this kind of thing, and more to the point, how they don’t realise what it is they are implying.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, April 18th, 2008 at 11:02 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nJoseph Muscat plans to set up a call centre at Labour HQ\\nWe all know by now that the Labour Party has suffered three consecutive electoral defeats. What we forget is that they come hot on the heels of another three consecutive defeats – 1981, 1987 and 1992 – separated only by Alfred Sant’s brief legislature. It is necessary to take in that full picture when considering the extent of the mess that the party is in right now.\\nThe strange thing is that one is left with the distinct impression that the party’s movers and shakers are unaware of this, and imagine that once a new leader is installed, things can go on pretty much as they were. I listen to what they say and read what they write, and the common thread is that the March 8 result was so close that the Labour Party didn’t lose. No. It almost won.\\nIt is a crucial distinction. The ‘almost won’ mindset imagines that no fundamental change is required to secure the seat of government in 2013. This is dangerous thinking. Those big Labour cheeses should be waking up every day to chant the mantra ‘we lost’ until the truth sinks in. Only then will there truly be the drive for change. As things stand, there barely seems to be the will to understand what went wrong, though the answers are staring them in the face and are obvious even to me. For the Nationalist Party, on the other hand, the drive to change comes from repeating the phrase ‘we almost lost’ and not ‘we won’.\\nI don’t belong to the ranks of those who are astonished at the victory, who are amazed that it could be done and that it was done. Rather the opposite – I am shocked that such a rubbish party, with such ridiculous and risky policies, with such dreadful politicians and so disorganized, and above all, led by a serial loser who disparaged democracy and who even claimed to have won the referendum on Europe, almost got into government. It’s disgraceful. It says so much about Malta that I would prefer not to hear.\\nI know that around 47% of the population will vote for the Labour Party even if it is swimming in a slew of ineptitude, violence and corruption. They will vote for the party if it is led by a one-eyed talking monkey wearing a suit. But this really was too much. When I heard that the majority was of just 1,500, my reaction was of disbelief, disillusionment and utter cynicism that, despite the changes of the last 21 years, roughly half the Maltese population continues to think as it did before those changes had taken place. Malta has opened up, but our minds are still closed. People who acknowledged that Gonzi would make a far better prime minister than Sant still went ahead and voted to make Sant prime minister, out of some absurd tribal loyalty.\\nNow we sit and watch the Labour leadership soap opera and wonder where it will take us. There is just one contender who can become leader, and there is just one contender who can lift the party out of the trough of hapless misery in which it now wallows. The dilemma the party faces is that they are not the same person. Joseph Muscat will become leader, and George Abela will, for the second time, become the boat that Labour missed. It is George Abela, and not Joseph Muscat, who appeals to those who haven’t voted Labour recently or who have never voted Labour. It is George Abela who can help rein them in by removing the fright factor from the Labour Party. But that’s not going to happen.\\nJoseph Muscat is already disturbing floaters and people like me, and that’s just after a couple of weeks of his leadership campaign. He does not disturb us because we think he will be a good party leader who will ‘steal’ the election from ‘our’ party. Oh no. He is disturbing in the same way that Alfred Sant, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and Dom Mintoff were disturbing, but for different reasons. We know that there’s something wrong there, but we just can’t put our finger on it yet. The other contenders are not disturbing in this way; they are simply hopeless and inept. They are not driven in that frightening way that convinces one they have some personal project in mind and are going to claw their way to the top to implement it at whatever cost to the country. They just come across as chancers who are trying their luck but who have no real hope of getting anywhere.\\nMuscat seems to think that if Sant swung it, then he can too. Oh, how wrong he is. When Sant came along in 1992, lots of moderates and floaters and pale-blue Nationalists had never noticed him before. They didn’t know his history in the party. They were so relieved to see a Labour leader who seemed smart and who wore a suit and came across as normal – though the least said about that, the better – that all he needed to do was promise to get rid of VAT and he was on to a winner. But Sant wrote his own political death-warrant, and no Labour leader in the same mould is going to be trusted again within this time-span of living memory. The factor working most strongly against Muscat is that he is cloned on Sant. He reminds us of him, and we don’t like that.\\nThis sentiment is going to pick up force as Muscat’s campaign goes on a roll and we begin to see more of him and hear more of what he has to say. His two most recent and prominent appearances on television, on TVM’s Bondiplus and Dissett, were nerve-wracking. He gave an off-putting account of himself, but at the same time, it was clear that he is precisely the sort to impress unsophisticated party delegates. The attributes we class as repellent they would probably see as desirable.\\nNow Muscat has announced that he will be holding public meetings, and also gathering delegates together. I have heard through the political grapevine that he has used the system which pays for MEPs to organize familiarization trips to Brussels, for associates from their home countries, to host Labour Party delegates and show them around there. What do they call it? Oh, yes – the power of incumbency.\\nHe has just given a press conference in which he ‘outlined his vision for the party’. Like his predecessors, he is taken up with making the mistake of differentiating between the party and the country. The Nationalist Party’s success is rooted in the fact that its visions inevitably encompass the entire country, and not just the party. Political parties are about organization. They do not need an internal vision to work properly and efficiently. Any vision that a party builds must be a vision for the country, one that draws in the country and gets the country to vote for it.\\nYet there was Muscat, telling reporters that the Labour Party’s structures need to be updated, and that the party needs to be more responsive to current needs (tell us something we don’t know). The party needs to be more ‘open and inclusive’ he said, bringing together the moderate and progressive people of Malta. But to do that, he must first work out why the moderates and the progressives have beaten a path to the doors of the Nationalist Party in droves over the last couple of decades. Labour is now a very curious political creature: a right-wing, ultra-conservative and xenophobic animal that doesn’t understand business, mistrusts the making of money, and is beset by paranoia and class hatred.\\nI was waiting for it, and there I found it, in a newspaper report of his press conference: “Dr Muscat said he was proposing the creation of public fora and think tanks which would review and propose party policy.” Oh dear god in heaven. I wondered when those ‘tink-tanks’ were going to appear. They are so typically pseudo-intellectual-outdated-Labour, and it doesn’t take much to work out where the idea came from if you know who’s helping run Muscat’s campaign. The idea that policies are developed by intellectuals in think-tanks is about as appealingly fresh and modern as a live reading of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance or Jonathan Livingston Seagull. But that’s what happens when your advisers are stuck in their heyday, which coincided with the first appearance of flares and platform shoes. In the contemporary world, policies are developed by people who know about life, and more importantly, who have experience of what they are talking about. Alfred Sant inhabited a fictionalized world in which theory, divorced from reality, shaped his ‘narrative’. I hope this isn’t going to become a habit with Labour.\\nJoseph Muscat does seem to realise that new policies ‘in accordance with European norms’ are called for, but how he is going to drag the party across the political spectrum from a strange variant of right-wing conservatism to something more liberal is quite beyond me. His great plans for reforming the Labour Party include a call centre. Yes, really – would you credit it? People call a party number and complain or suggest something. This is so unbelievably crass that I just want to flop down and weep in despair. Meanwhile, a bank of telephone operators sits there and takes complaints and suggestions about the party (“Silvio Parnis should wear less gel.”). This won’t achieve anything and it will run up even greater debts for the financially crippled party.\\nHe also places too much faith in the Internet, and is one of the several Labour exponents who imagine that the Labour Party was damaged in this last election by its failure to be present in cyberspace. Ah, but what came first, the chicken or the egg? There were lots of pro-Nationalist views on the Internet during the electoral campaign because the kinds of people who are comfortable on the Internet tend to be the kinds of people who vote Nationalist, and not because the Nationalist Party placed them there. There was nothing to stop Labour supporters posting comments on blogs and on-line newspapers, but few of them did so. It’s not a presence on the Internet that the Labour Party needs, but more supporters who belong to the Internet generation. That it doesn’t have them is entirely its own fault.\\nMuscat also plans to review the party media. This inevitably means the production of a newspaper in the kind of English that those who prefer to read English never write or speak, as with the Labour Party’s ridiculous news website, Maltastar.com, which seems to exist solely to get a thrill out of publishing semi-pornographic stories and images.\\nI can see the picture forming before my eyes already: a party reform project that will get bogged down in the nitty-gritty of newspapers, Internet, call-centres, think-tanks and ‘openness’, while the Nationalist Party puts its nose to the grindstone and sees to the business of winning the next election.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n\\nJoseph Muscat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, April 19th, 2008 at 9:23 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhile Joseph Muscat banged on about think-tanks, policies wrought by intellectuals, call centres for party people with problems (a good role for Silvio Parnis, who ran a similar show on Super One Radio for years) and his qualifications as an ‘economist and manager’ (which made him sound even more like Sant), George Abela continued to widen the credibility gap between the two.\\nHere are some things he said at a press conference this morning. You will realise immediately why he appeals to people like me. It’s because his thinking reflects the issues that drove us out to vote PN in the last few general elections.\\n\\nThe Labour Party should take part in EU-related matters out of conviction.\\nThe Labour Party should attack arguments, not individuals.\\nThe Labour media should inform, educate and entertain, and must reflect truth, quality, decency and respect individual dignity even in the case of those who oppose the Labour Party.\\nThe Labour Party should build and maintain good relations with all media.\\nThe Labour Party will work for good quality education that is free of charge for all, and will ensure that high standards are maintained in state, church and independent schools.\\nMalta should achieve the Lisbon strategy benchmarks as soon as possible.\\nThe Labour Party will maintain free quality healthcare while cooperating with private healthcare providers.\\nThe Labour Party will be committed to the environment and will build and maintain close working relationships with non-governmental organisations.\\nLabour must encourage private investment in the generation of wealth, and must create an environment conducive to this, by cutting down on bureaucracy and ensuring that the state does not compete with private enterprise.\\nThere should be a good balance between direct and indirect taxation, and taxation must not serve as a barrier to private endeavour or initiative.\\nLabour should promote clean, transparent and efficient public administration, and must ensure that taxes are well spent, not least on social services.\\nLabour needs a new way of doing politics. It cannot go on with its siege mentality.\\nWe need to work towards consensus, because the politics of confrontation are damaging to the people.\\n\\nNow ask me again why I think he is the best leader the Labour Party could have, and why the prospect of him as prime minister will not send us all out to fight in the trenches once more.\\nAs he said, the Labour Party just can’t afford to lose another election. I’ll go one further and say that the Nationalist Party can’t afford to win another one. And the country can’t afford to have Joseph Muscat – who belongs behind a desk in some financial services firm – as prime minister. But given a choice between the damage caused to the Nationalist Party by winning yet another election and the damage caused to the country by having Joseph Muscat as prime minister, I’ll choose the former any day. So with Joseph Muscat as party leader, I’m afraid it’s going to be trench-time again in 2013, unless I’ve packed up and left for somewhere nicer.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIf you’re a private person found dead on the lavatory of a drug overdose, your name is published in the newspapers. If you’re a 20-year-old who crashes and dies on the way home after a night out, your name is broadcast, your dead body filmed, the blood on the ground brought into focus, and the contents of your car (hairbrush, handbag, hair-dryer) itemised in the newspapers. If you steal a handbag, your name and – if you’re not Maltese – nationality are spelled out in the press.\\nAh, but if you’re a pervert who preys on children, that’s different, and you’re entitled to privacy even when you’re convicted. Usually, the name of the aggressor/predator is kept out of the news – by order of the court – only when he is directly related to or connected with his victim. And this is done to protect the privacy of the victim, not the sexual deviant. So if X is convicted of ‘defiling’ his neighbour’s six-year-old daughter, X’s name is not published because then it would be a simple matter of identifying the girl.\\nThe only case I can recall in which there was no ban on the publication of names of men accused of abusing children in their care is that of the dreadful Pandolfino brothers. And that was a good thing, too, given that they used to run a riding-school for children.\\nBut now we have had a surprising new development. A 37-year-old man was found guilty of sending sexy text messages to his pupils and of having innuendo-laden exchanges with them in Internet chat-rooms when he taught religion – if you please – at a private school. He admitted his guilt, and was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for four years. Of course, he no longer teaches at the school.\\nThe magistrate ordered a ban on the publication of the names of the school, pupils and teacher. I can understand the ban on the pupils’ names, but the school? Like every other organisation, if it has a public relations problem as big as this, it just has to deal with it. It shouldn’t expect the court to conceal its identity and, in so doing, conceal important information from parents and other pupils. But clearly, it did expect the court to do this and was successful in securing the ban, unless it was the magistrate’s initiative.\\nAs for concealing the name of the pervert-cum-religion-teacher, this beggars belief. People are entitled to know who this man is, not least so that he is not allowed into contact with children again, and not just in a school either. He might have friends with children or a girlfriend with children, or even brothers and sisters with children. Those who think that they were ‘only’ text messages or ‘only’ Internet comments are naïve.\\nMost interestingly of all, this story appeared briefly on The Times’ news portal this afternoon under the heading ‘Teacher admits sending SMSes with sexual connotations to students’. It had already begun to generate a stream of comments when it suddenly disappeared, and can’t be accessed now. Of course, that should be ‘pupils’ and not ‘students’ – college and university students are more than able to cope with sexy messages from irritating teachers, even though it still constitutes an offence. With pupils in a school classroom, it’s a different matter altogether.\\nBring back pupils\\nWill somebody please explain to me why the word ‘pupils’ has disappeared from the lexicon in Malta? Children in school are not students. They’re pupils. You become a student when you go to college or university. The Americans use the word ‘students’ to describe kids in school, but our variant of the language is supposed to be British English, not American English. The newspapers insist on calling schoolchildren ‘students’ and the schools themselves are making this mistake. I remember ripping up in irritation practically every circular I received from the independent school my sons went to, and struggling against the urge to scrawl PUPILS in large red letters across it before posting it back. I can’t stand this kind of sloppiness. Different words have discrete meanings – hence students and pupils. Anyone who speaks British English and reads a headline about a teacher sending sexy messages to students will automatically assume that those students were post-pubescent and that the man in question wasn’t a paedophile.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nMark Vella Gera was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for four years, for sexually propositioning primary-school boys at St Michael’s independent school. He was also a teacher at tal-Muzew, but of course, we haven’t had any court cases about that one. What did we tell you about never trusting a man who wears a goatee? \\nThe law is specific in that magistrates and judges may only ban the publication of details (any details) of a court case, or discussion about it, while it is underway. Once the matter has been decided, and even if the decision has been appealed against, the magistrate or judge may ban only the name/s of the victim/s, and that to protect their privacy where there has been abuse. The name/s of the perpetrator/s may be banned only if he/she/they are minors.\\nSo, if the name of a criminal has been banned by the court in blatant disregard of what the law specifies, and more particularly if the crime in question is a sexual offence against children, then I feel obliged to ignore that ban and to ask the magistrate to justify his stance.\\nWould that the editors of our newspapers were to get together and challenge these offensive bans on the publication of the names of criminals once and for all.\\nThe man who was sentenced, yesterday, to two years in prison suspended for four years, for sexually propositioning primary-school boys – not secondary-school girls – when he was their religion teacher is Mark Vella Gera, born June 1970. The incidents occurred when he taught at St Michael School. He has since been dismissed.\\nMark Vella Gera also taught doctrine classes for the MUSEUM (tal-Muzew). Call me prejudiced, but I would never trust a man who actively seeks to spend his afternoons and evenings in the company of young children, to teach them ‘religion’, especially when it is not his job and he is not getting paid for it. Why would a mentally healthy man want to spend his free time doing that, instead of running around with women or taking up some normal hobby or interest? How many men do you know who find other people’s young children in sizeable groups (and even their own) anything other than exhausting and irritating after anything longer than 10 minutes?\\nMark Vella Gera is an amateur meteorologist who runs the organisation Malta Weather (on the net, at maltaweather.com). He has been fascinated by the weather all his life, he claims on his site. So now we must ask ourselves whether he got into teaching, and more specifically, teaching religion, purely to put himself into contact with large numbers of young children. You don’t get that with the weather.\\n  \\n\\n\\nMark Vella Gera\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 23rd, 2008 at 5:20 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThis is what a lunch-time peacock looks like.\\nI thought peacocks were lunch (400 years ago, at least), but now it seems that they go out to lunch, too – as distinct from being out to lunch, that is.\\nI popped into Valletta for a super-quick lunch of steamed fish and steamed vegetables (lest Kurt Farrugia describes me once more as ‘self-floated’ when he means self-inflated) at The Carriage today, and who did I see when I walked in? I saw Jason Micallef, lunching a deux with Joseph Muscat’s campaign elder, Godfrey Grima.

One thing he said is that what works when writing about a cat stuck up a tree, or a football match, or council elections – giving each side equal time or space – does not necessarily work when it comes to a war or the Holocaust. “If reporting on the Holocaust, would you give equal time to the SS captain?” he asked his audience.\\nHe took the argument to the extreme to make his point, but the same can be said of political reporting in Malta, especially with our state television. Sometimes the Labour Party does something worth reporting, and sometimes the Nationalist Party does. If it’s not worth reporting, don’t report it. And if it should be reported, then report it. Anything else makes nonsense of the news, and giving them equal time insults the intelligence of the viewer. Yes, lots of viewers are intelligent, and those who are not should still be treated with respect.\\n\\nFrom time to time I receive one of those round-robin emails about Muslims taking over Britain, and how we shouldn’t let them take over Malta. That would be difficult, given that the Catholics took over around 600 years ago and haven’t released their clutches yet. What the senders of these emails don’t seem to understand is that the British protests are against the ‘taking over’ of secularism by religion, and the taking over of the Christian way of life by Islam. It’s a safe bet that if British Catholics of Italian, Maltese and Spanish extraction were to behave the same way, they would get exactly the same reaction.\\nIn all the emails, variants of the same pictures are attached of women wrapped in black and bearded men carrying placards calling for death to those who insult Islam. When the messages are from people I know, rather than from people I don’t know, I always reply. I say that I find this kind of thinking as deeply offensive as the sentiments expressed on the ‘death to those who insult Islam’ placards, and would the person in question remove me from that particular email group. Thank you.\\nThe last time this happened was two days ago. My acquaintance emailed back with the usual chestnut that ‘we’ tolerate ‘these people’ in ‘our’ territory and then they behave like that. And just imagine if ‘we’ were to go to ‘their’ countries and behave in the same way. Where does one begin to explain? It would take forever, and in the face of prejudice that has been formed by inadequate knowledge of history, philosophy, geography and current affairs, it’s generally useless.\\nThere are a hundred points one wishes to make, but chief among them is the fact that the west passed through the Age of Enlightenment, which advocated reason rather than religion as the primary basis for authority. Europe is tolerant now despite the full efforts of the Catholic Church and its various Christian off-shoots and breakaway parties, and not because of them. Islamic states, on the other hand, are exactly where European states were before the Enlightenment. God’s rules, or what they see as God’s rules, are the rules of the state. They are theocracies.\\nThe reason the west is tolerant is because it is secular, and not because it is Christian. States that are religious rather than secular are intolerant whatever the religion. Catholic European states were supremely intolerant – violently and cruelly so. The reason that there is so much intolerance in Malta is because it is only partly secular, but mainly a theocracy. God and the rules of Catholicism remain the first point of reference for legislators and the people for vote for them. The process has been slower here.\\nDavid Abulafia has had published a fascinating new book, The Discovery of Mankind: Atlantic Encounters in the Age of Columbus. We all know by now that the Catholic Europeans who first made their way into the New World across the ocean treated the people they found there with great savagery. They were hardly great ambassadors for their religion, but that was of far secondary importance to them when compared to the desire to exploit the mineral resources they found. What most of us don’t know is that not everyone thought or behaved that way – that cruel and savage barbarism were recognisable as such even to contemporaneous observers. Some Spaniards protested, most notably Bartoleme de las Casas, who had witnessed massacres during the subjugation of Cuba. He wrote passionate epistles against this kind of injustice, that are seen as a major step on the way to the concept of human rights and the legislation that followed centuries later.\\nTo give their conquest the merest veil of legality, the Spanish read out a proclamation to the peoples they encountered on beaches and in jungles. They were exhorted, in a language they did not understand, to give up their territory to these strange-looking people wearing alien garb, and to ‘acknowledge the (Catholic) Church as the Ruler and Superior of the whole world.’ If they put up a fight, they were taken into slavery and told that ‘the deaths and losses which shall accrue from this are your fault’.\\nOne Cuban chieftain delivered a damning verdict on the Spanish Catholic invaders who destroyed his people’s culture and eventually annihilated those people altogether through persecution and disease. As they prepared to burn him at the stake for the crime of opposing their wishes, they warned him to accept Christ before death or face eternal damnation. The chieftain asked if heaven is where Christians go when they die. “When told that they did,” Bartoleme de las Casas wrote in a contemporary account of the event, “he said that he would prefer to go to hell.”\\nIf heaven and hell do exist, the chieftain and those who burnt him must have wondered, when they arrived, who got the arrangements mixed up.\\n\\nI am more than a little tired of the endless protestations against abortion, which have erupted yet again because of that business with the Council of Europe. The newspapers are filled once more with hysterical letters and articles holding Malta up as the last bastion against this craven evil. We’re not the last bastion, because that’s a dubious honour we share with Islamic states (horrors).\\nThroughout, I am left with the nagging suspicion that our objection shares its roots with Islam on two counts: religion, and the discounting of women’s dignity and integrity. We talk about the baby, the baby, the baby, bringing forth a mental picture of one of those jolly little things on Anne Geddes birthday cards, all cuddly and pretty and with flowers in its hair. The woman is never factored into the equation.\\nIt’s a little bit harder to feel emotionally galvanised about a couple of cells two days after conception, which is why the most emotionally-wrought among us refer even to this, with biological inaccuracy, as ‘the baby’. It is so far removed from a baby that when two-thirds of these conceptions are flushed down the lavatory, as happens naturally, the woman doesn’t even notice and probably didn’t even know she was pregnant (“Oh, how odd, my period’s late this month. I hope I’m not pregnant.” Oh darling, but you were and you didn’t notice.)\\nAs somebody pointed out elsewhere, if we’re claiming that ‘ensoulment’, a very odd word that my computer doesn’t recognise and which isn’t in my Oxford Dictionary, takes place immediately upon conception, then what we are also saying is that there are more souls in heaven who were never born at all than there are souls who actually lived. This leaves us with another problem for those who believe that they will be reunited in heaven with those they knew on this earth, and who even see these presences in near-death experiences. How is something that leaves a woman’s body naturally and without her noticing it, two days after sexual intercourse, represented in heaven? And how will we women recognise our ‘children’ when we meet them in the afterlife, given that they’ll all look the same – correction, given that we won’t be able to see them without a microscope?\\n\\nThese legalistic debates about heaven leave me cold with boredom in any case. It’s life on earth, in the here and now, with which a secular state should be concerned, instead of taking to platforms in international forums to behave like Islamic mullahs. And no, there’s no difference; when you represent the state, protesting against legislation, ideas or concepts on the basis of religion is unacceptable whatever the religion. When you’re a private individual, you do whatever you like because it’s your prerogative and you live in a free country. Those who want to speak out against abortion are free to do so – and not because Malta is a Catholic country, but because it respects free speech. Equally, those who want to object to their views are free to do so too. When you represent the state, it’s a different matter.\\nThe time for hysteria, and yes, I know it is an unfortunate choice of word given that it is derived from the Greek for womb, and high emotion is long gone. The government, instead of contributing to the screaming and shouting, must pull its head out of the sand and assess the situation properly and realistically. What we are saying here is that Malta can afford to have no abortion because, in effect, it does have abortion – a brief catamaran ride away with no passport or foreign exchange required. Abortion is actually far more accessible to Maltese women than it is to millions of women the world over, in countries where abortion is legal but where the closest clinic is several hours away.\\nWhat this means is that our position on abortion is buoyed up by the immediate availability of abortion and so it is nothing short of hypocritical. There is strong demand for abortion in Malta, and it is being met in Sicily, or London as it has been for decades, with a spot of shopping around it. The mental illness of having an abortion? The depression of ending an unwanted pregnancy? Funny how it is mainly men and women who are divorced from their femininity who believe these things and who talk about them Real women, on the other hand, know that far more mental illness and depression are caused by actually having babies, even if you desperately wanted them, but especially if you had them against your will. If having babies were not essential for the survival of the human race, it would be outlawed as a dangerous sport. Instead of talking about the women who should be forcibly prevented from having abortions in case they get depressed, let’s spend some time actually caring for all those thousands of women in Malta who are either coping with post-natal depression right now as you read this, or are still suffering from the fall-out, years later, of post-natal depression that spiralled out of control when the illness wasn’t acknowledged because women who have babies are supposed to be happy. One of my dearest friends killed herself at the age of 30 and left three children behind after developing a mental illness provoked by childbirth. I know several women whose lives and mental health have been destroyed by having children at the wrong time, or when they didn’t want them, or by being unable to cope mentally even though they wanted them. The children suffer, the woman suffers, her husband suffers, and eventually, after some years, the whole thing falls apart.\\nAnd in case you were wondering, this is not an argument for abortion. It’s an argument against hypocrisy. It’s an argument against the strange belief that Malta objects to abortion when thousands of Maltese women have had abortions in Italian and British clinics over the years. It’s an argument against the argument that abortion makes a woman mentally unwell but childbirth and child-raising do not. It’s an argument in favour of commonsense and against religious hysteria, which never brought anything other than harm to humanity.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe literal-minded Lorna Vassallo has finally woken up and discovered this website and boy, is she upset at being made fun of and called Lara Croft. It’s a good thing she doesn’t spend her holidays trawling round the ice, because then I’d have had to call her Scott of the Antarctic. That’s what happens when you put your kitchen on your website, Lorna, and set about telling us how and why you’re a vegetarian and where you went for your holidays, while campaigning for a political party. And remember that it doesn’t pay to let everyone know that you were born without a sense of humour. Perhaps we should introduce Lorna to Harry Vassallo, who doesn’t have one either. The Jacques-Rene she mentions is Jacques Zammit, another Lorna aficionado.\\nSee you too, Lorna – we can chat about your thrilling trips with the natives in the south American jungle – but don’t wear your tight leather hot-pants and corset or the clerks will get palpitations.\\nLorna Vassallo Thursday, 24 April 1110hrs\\nI discovered your comments lately.\\nWe’ll soon be seeing each other in court I guess … dear Daphne.\\nAnd Jacques-Rene too.\\nSee you\\nUnder Lorna Vassallo goes to Venezuela.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn all the years that we have lived in a rural area, rather than in town, our every spring has been marred by the sound of gunfire. From before dawn to dusk and beyond, the sound has echoed through the valley and across the fields. We have been regularly woken at five o’clock, and even the supposedly quietest day of the week has been torn apart by illegal Sunday shooters. We have watched birds of prey circling high overhead while men with guns go mad below. We have picked up small dead bodies from the garden, and we have rarely had the pleasure of listening to birdsong.\\nThis is the first time in all these years that we haven’t heard a single volley as the days get brighter, warmer and longer. Well, there was just the one, but whoever it was must have been moved along pretty sharpish, because there was nothing after that. Except for the very odd few, the shooters appear to be respecting the law, however much they may disagree with it. That in itself speaks volumes about a change in attitude. They may object to the law, but at least they are not out and about defying it, though the violence against members of Birdlife, which is being attributed to shooters, does nothing to help their cause but rather the opposite.\\nAnd yes, the ban on shooting in spring does make a difference. I can’t say that the sky is dark with flocks of birds, but when I am in the house with the windows open, it is like being in an aviary. The sound of birdsong is so loud, and there seem to be so many of them. Eventually, with luck – though it will be years before the birds trust us again – we may get to the stage where larger, more impressive birds fly freely about, giving us the chance to look at them. I look back with sadness at the fact that my first-ever encounter with a significant wild bird, at the age of around eight, was with a dead hawk, its carcass blasted open by gun-shot, on a walk through the fields.\\n\\nEverywhere I walk in the streets, I seem to hear men grumbling loudly about the ban, their supportive wives muttering by their side while privately thanking the powers-that-be that their days as the gun-widows of the neurotically obsessed are over, in spring at least. The grumbling is deliberately loud, so that as many people as possible may hear the rebel with a cause. Look what the government has done to us. This was our sole love and passion and now we have nothing. If I am not allowed to hunt in spring then I will die. I’m seeing a doctor and taking kalmanti. I can’t sleep at night. If a person has a pastime, why deprive him of its pleasure? Hunting is a Maltese tradition and we shouldn’t let Europe interfere. Those birds are ours and I have a right to shoot them if I want to. It’s not as though thousands of birds pass overhead, so what’s all the fuss about? Birds breed like rabbits, so it doesn’t matter if we shoot some of them.\\nAnd all I can think of is that the government had to take shelter behind the European Union before firing this one off, and that without EU membership it would never have happened. If only the EU had such jurisdiction over civil rights, too – then we wouldn’t have one government after another falling over itself to appease the most conservative and backward elements of the religious right. But that’s out of the question.\\nThe ban on hunting this spring is but an interim measure, handed down by the European Court of Justice as a stop-gap solution until it takes a decision on the main suit brought against Malta by the European Commission. That suit is expected to be brought to its conclusion within two years. The European Commission didn’t want Maltese shooters and trappers going on a spree and making the most of this spring and the next, so it asked for this interim decision. It got the ban for 2008, on grounds of urgency, but the court said that there is no such urgency where 2009 is concerned, and so a separate request must be made.\\nIt’s sad that our own government didn’t have the guts to suspend shooting and trapping of its own accord, and had to be ordered to do so instead, but there you go. Sometimes it pays to be Pilate.\\nThe European Commission said after the court’s interim judgement was announced: “The decision of the European Court of Justice is quite clear. Spring hunting should not be allowed (in Malta) until the final judgement on the original case instituted by the European Commission against Malta is given. If the European Commission sees that the Maltese government is planning to allow hunting in the spring of 2009, it will decide on whether to apply once again for interim measures. We expect the Maltese authorities to abide by this decision and not to allow spring hunting any longer.”\\nThe government had been served with a written warning last October on the hunting of quail and turtle-doves in spring, but did nothing about it. It would have been ill-advised to do anything about it with an election in the offing, but now that’s in the bag, the government can take the initiative and crack down without waiting to be cracked down on itself.\\n\\nThe problem with so many shooters and trappers here is that they don’t seem to understand that these are not ‘our’ birds simply because they are in our territory. They have no understanding of the fact that the thinking on migratory birds (and they don’t have to be migratory, either) has evolved towards their being part of Europe’s common heritage. It is not just Europe, either, because most of them migrate between Europe and Africa.\\nWhen the birds fly over Malta at this time of the year, they are returning to their northern European homes, where they breed, after wintering in Africa. They don’t breed in Africa (which should keep Norman Lowell and his band of merry nutters happy) but in Europe, which means that when they are shot in Malta, they haven’t yet had time to reproduce. Every bird taken out in Malta reduces the population not just by that one bird, but exponentially. This is something else that the shooters and trappers pretend not to understand – or understand and hope that the problem will sort itself out.\\nOn television the other day I heard one trapper argue: but don’t cats catch birds, so why can’t we? Oh baby, we’re supposed to be more civilised than cats. And cats don’t have guns and traps. We really do have a long way to go if hunters see themselves as part and parcel of the animal kingdom, instead of waiting for us to dismiss them as such.\\nAnother man, this time a shooter, was told by his interviewer, Reno Bugeja on TVM’s Dissett, that there are far more people who strenuously object to bird-hunting than there are who are passionate about it. His reply was that this is immaterial, “because hunting came before them.” Bugeja then went to a ‘hanut tat-te’ in Rabat, where he vox-popped some other hunters, all of whom looked suitably depressed and spoke dramatically. “I have nothing left in this life.” “My life is over.” “I am feeding a dog for nothing.” “Everything I love is gone.” “If the government doesn’t put things back the way they were, I’m going to leave Malta.” (Iss! Ar’hemm, hej – that will be one fewer to be getting on with.)\\nWhat makes you think you have the right to shoot those birds, when they’re not yours, Bugeja asked. “Of course they’re mine!” the my-life-is-over shooter replied, the black circles round his eyes even bigger than Jason Micallef’s on 9 March. “Yes, those birds are mine because I pay to practise my sport.” Oh, the bliss of illogical thinking.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis letter is carried in The Times today. It is written by a psychiatrist of Maltese origin who lives and works in New South Wales. Sometimes it takes the perspective of a view from the outside to help us see the insanity of some of our decisions and thinking.\\n\\nChildren at risk\\nCarmelo Aquilina, Glebe, NSW, Australia\\nI must express my disquiet over the report I read on The Times (April 23) about a suspended jail sentence given to a teacher for sending sexually-explicit text messages to 13- and 14-year-old pupils.\\nThe report mentions that the magistrate ordered that the man’s teaching warrant be withdrawn and that he “keeps away from schools and institutions that have minors in attendance”.\\nAlthough I do not know the details of the case, as a psychiatrist, I can categorically say that he shows signs that he is sexually- attracted to children and at 37 years of age this is now not just a momentary lapse but a lifelong tendency called paedophilia. Such people tend to “groom” children, meaning that they try and win the confidence of children in order to gain close contact with them before getting them to have sex with him.\\nGrooming can involve contacting children through the internet and SMS messaging but it can also involve befriending parents or children’s clubs so that they can then be trusted to take children out for walks or swims, to do baby-sitting, private lessons, etc. The court order in his case focuses only on schools and is inadequate to control all the other ways this man could be a risk to others. In the UK or Australia he would have no right of anonymity and releasing his name often brings about other reports of inappropriate behaviour from other parents or victims.\\nAt the very least, his probation conditions should have prohibited all unsupervised contact with children, having psychiatrists, social workers and probation officers monitor his whereabouts.\\nIf the state allows this man to remain anonymous and not supervised properly, then it will have some responsibility in the tragedies which could follow.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nDom Mintoff, in the days when he took showers and didn’t think the police were tracking him through his hearing-aid, with his little friend Kim Il Sung.\\nYes, Joseph Muscat must have been very excited to see that old fossil Mintoff turn up at George Abela’s rally. Ma’ min rajtek, xebbahtek; birds of a feather flock together. You get the drift. Dom Mintoff’s is hardly the best endorsement Abela can hope to get. It’s marginally worse than Joseph Muscat labouring under the spectre of Darth Vader – but that, at least, comes with the very useful party machine attached.\\nThe last thing Abela needs is Mintoff leading his chorus of cheerleaders. Yes, it might make for popularity among that particular faction of the Labour Party, but it will send everyone else screaming for the hills. This is not because anyone at all fears that the decrepit remnant of Malta’s most hated prime minister will, at the age of 91, exert any kind of influence at all on the running of the party under Abela (that remains a real fear where the Sant/Muscat combo is concerned). No, it’s because Mintoff is associated with the darkest period in recent Maltese history, a period for which he was directly responsible. He needs to be kept at arm’s length.\\nThe credibility gap between Abela and Muscat has over the last couple of weeks been widening in Abela’s favour. But with recent mentions of Mintoff, and now his appearance at Abela’s rally, the credibility gap shrinks again and Abela loses the moral high ground and some of his reputation for soundness.\\nMintoff is clearly not all there, in any case. He should be kept out of the public view if his fans wish him to be remembered as a fierce leader rather than as a shambolic old man whose mind is wandering and who isn’t particularly committed to daily ablutions. It gives me a peculiar satisfaction to see the pathetic sight he now presents – sic transit gloria mundi. Not all those who are in their 90s speak without making a word of sense. Not all of them stop taking showers and lose all interest in how they look and smell. But that has been Mintoff’s fate, and a particularly cruel one at that, given that he built his political career on an ability to manipulate the ignorant and the poorly educated with words. Some people thought this was oratorical skill. It was anything but, given that few of the words had more than two syllables, and those that did were obscene.\\nAt one point, Mintoff actually told Abela’s crowd that the police are using his hearing-aid to track his movements. You got it: the Paraventu put a tracking device in Mintoff’s ear just in case he sneaks off for a secret rendezvous with Robert Mugabe. So we have paranoia now, too – but then we already knew that when we read his letter to George Bush or whoever, complaining that he was being spied on by the CIA.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, April 28th, 2008 at 10:35 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nI will use every weapon in my arsenal to get what I want.\\nThe newspaper Illum has in its possession a copy of a personal letter which Alfred Mifsud wrote to Alfred Sant in the tense weeks leading up to the general election in 1998.

Or maybe Jason did it.

F’din l-ittra Mifsud kiteb lil Sant, dakinhar Prim Ministru, u fiha saħansitra offra lil Sant li “jekk issir elezzjoni ġenerali, għodd fuqi biex nimla kull post amministrattiv battal li jħalli George Abela.”\\nIkkuntattjat minn din il-gazzetta Mifsud kien mistoqsi x’wassal biex għamel din il-bidla u minkejja li fl-1998 kien ħadem ‘kontra’ Abela issa qed jersaq lejh u jaħdem għalih. “Ghaxar snin ilu kienu ċirkustanzi mod u llum 10 snin wara hemm ċirkustanzi mod ieħor. Jien kulma jinteressani hu li l-Partit Laburista jitla’ fil-Gvern. Jien naħseb li George Abela hu l-aħjar għażla għax l-aktar wieħed li jagħtina prospetti tajbin. Għaddew 10 snin u kulħadd hu 10 snin aktar matur,” saħaq Mifsud.\\nL-ittra ta’ Mifsud datata 10 ta’ Lulju 1998 inkitbet fit-tieni ġurnata tal-Konferenza Ġenerali Straordinarja tal-Partit Laburista. Mifsud fiha wissa lill-Prim Ministru Sant li “din hi sitwazzjoni li titlob ħsieb ċar u fehma ta’ xi ħadd barrani li tista’ ssaħħaħlek l-analiżi tiegħek u allura ddeċidejt li ndejqek bil-ħsibijiet tiegħi. Hu ċar li bħalissa int qed tissielet kontra minn ta’ l-anqas żewġ fazzjonijiet li konvenjentament ingħaqdu flimkien biex jiġġieldu kontra avversarju komuni.

B’dan il-mod Mintoff jikseb in-nomina tiegħu biex ikun President u George Abela jiġi s-salvatur tal-partit għax ikun ġibdu milli jidħol għal elezzjoni li int kont qed tmexxieh lejha.

The newspaper had become an extremely irritating hotch-potch jigsaw puzzle of pointless items pressed in among the adverts. Young people never picked it up and older people found it exhausting. The new look is much more pick-me-up-and-read-me attractive, but the all-important front page still needs more work if The Sunday Times is to become the newspaper we pick up first, rather than the one we pick up last, where those who buy all three English-language Sundays are concerned.\\nIt’s a pity that The Sunday Times revamp didn’t involve dumping that relic of a bygone age, Roamer and his column. Even my parents – though admittedly they are younger than he is – dismiss him as a relic from the 1960s, with stuffy views expressed in archaic language in a style that he tries to model on that of The Spectator, while failing miserably. At two generations younger than he is, I can’t even begin to relate to that way of thinking and have never been able to. And because I actually read The Spectator, I find his laboured language extremely tedious. To my sons, three generations younger but who belong to the all-important new generation of newspaper readers, he might as well have landed from a planet of aliens.\\nThe days of anonymous newspaper columnists are long gone, in any case. The London broadsheets, which began – centuries ago – the tradition of a newspaper column that used the same pseudonym as a by-line while the writers who wrote it changed from time to time, now spell out the writer’s name clearly beneath the column-pseudonym. So, for example, beneath the name of a traditional column called, say, Witch Hunter or Beachcomber or House Snoop, you’ll see the writer’s name, John Whitehouse or Mary Jones or Tom Rawlins.\\nKnowing the identity of a column-writer is important because the medium is the message, or at least part of it. The days when it was considered all right for writers to shout things out minn wara l-persjani are over. When exactly the same thing is said by a man and a woman, on gender issues for example, the implications are obviously different. When Marlene Pullicino pronounces herself against divorce on the grounds that she is a Catholic, even though she is married to one man but living with another one, her statement has to be considered in the context of her actions. Isn’t that obvious? Apparently not, because not even the person who interviewed her and elicited that answer saw fit to challenge her pronouncement.\\nAnd so it is with Roamer. For years we have been treated to his Sunday sermons on God, religion, Catholicism, abortion, children, gay rights, the family, the sanctity and desirability of marriage, the horror of divorce, and the stupidity of Daphne’s arguments – except that, as when speaking of the devil, he never mentions me by name lest he invokes me accidentally. Well, he’s invoked me now because I have had more than enough of him.\\nI have often felt like writing John Micallef a personal note (because I know exactly who he is), advising him of the wisdom of staying out of subjects about which he knows absolutely nothing, particularly when his pronouncements have this great air of mealy-mouthed hypocrisy about them. They simply don’t chime with what are called, nowadays, his lifestyle choices.\\nWhen John ‘Roamer’ Micallef pronounces himself on marriage, children and the family, he should make it clear to his readers that he has reached the age of nearly 80 while carefully avoiding marriage and fatherhood yet maintaining an (albeit decorous) relationship with the same widowed woman for almost half his time on earth. That’s his prerogative, of course, but it does raise plenty of questions about the dichotomy between his Sunday sermons on marriage and religion and his own personal choices.\\nAnd while he’s about it, this-Sunday-I’m-going-to-preach-against-divorce-again Roamer might wish to inform the remnants of his readership that some of his best friends are divorced (elsewhere, because they were able to) and even remarried, and that to the best of my knowledge he doesn’t tell them across the bridge-table that their choices are wrong and evil and that they run contrary to the will of the Mother Church. There is no hell-fire for John Micallef and his divorced-and-remarried friends, only for Roamer’s readers.\\nEnough of this ridiculous ‘hear what I say, don’t see what I do’ hypocrisy. At this rate, Malta will have become the new Sodom and Gomorrah and still we will be talking about the evils of divorce and how Catholic we are, while doing something else entirely.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn a pre-election interview, Nationalist candidate Pippo Psaila said words to the effect that Malta must follow the laws of the Catholic Church because Malta is Catholic, and that we shouldn’t have divorce for this reason.\\nIn a post-election interview, Labour MP Marlene Pullicino, who is married to Nationalist MP Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando (separated, yes, but not divorced so still married) but who has made another life with another man, said – somehow keeping her face straight and seeming to believe this in all seriousness – that she is against divorce and will vote against it in parliament because she is a Catholic. The Catholic Church says that you can’t have divorce (if you’re Catholic; if you’re not, then it’s up to you), and Dr Pullicino misinterprets its diktat and seeks to apply it even to non-Catholics who live here.\\nAh yes, but the Catholic Church also has a far more fundamental diktat – thou shalt not commit adultery, for it is a mortal sin – and Dr Pullicino hasn’t been so keen to rush to obey that one, or to help the government make it illegal. Stoning in a public square, anyone? Oh yes, let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\\nNow we have Nationalist MP Robert Arrigo, who said a few days ago, about the Council of Europe’s approval of an-equal-access-to-abortion resolution: “The Council of Europe tried to play God….Who are we to decide to terminate a life?”\\nExcuse me, but what does God have to do with it? Terminating a life is either wrong or it is not wrong, of itself. It is wrong, if you see it that way, not because it is playing God, or because we believe that God said so. It is wrong, again if you see it that way, because it is the ending of a life, and the ending of a life is wrong whether you believe in God or not.\\nGod, as I understand it, never got into the matter of abortion. There isn’t a single word about it in the Bible – and believe me, there has been abortion since there has been pregnancy. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, who also made that trip to the Council of Europe, at least didn’t stuff God or the Catholic Church into the equation, though he did help a lot to build up the legend of the Maltese mullahs who have never heard of the Age of Enlightenment. To make matters worse in terms of international public relations, these mullah-delegates are inevitably men.\\nSending a delegation of four men to bang on about God and the horror of abortion in an international forum has strong anti-women overtones. It smacks of something being imposed by repressive men on repressed Maltese women. It would have made much more sense to send four women, but there weren’t four women to send. There wasn’t even one woman to send. And that in itself speaks volumes.\\nOver in the comments section of the on-line newspapers, there are individuals who are actually declaring that the laws of Malta should reflect the laws of the Catholic Church, because ‘Malta is Catholic’. In 2008, this is astonishing. It means that these people have horrendous gaps in their education – the gap between the Age of Enlightenment and the present day, most specifically.\\nAs I explained it to one of them, who bossily colonises the comment sections to preach the righteousness of God (a Catholic God, take note): I am not a Catholic. You are a Catholic. We are both Maltese citizens. I am not a second-class Maltese citizen and you are not a first-class Maltese citizen. How, then, do you get to set the religious rules by which I have to live, whether I want to or not? Her come-back, such as it was, was that the rules of the church are an excellent basis for the ordering of society, and it has nothing to do with religion. Yes, I agree that the laws of Moses (not the laws of Catholicism) are inordinately useful in helping edgy tribes to rub along relatively peacefully in the desert while foraging for food and without killing each other over a coveted neighbour’s wife, but I think even Marlene Pullicino will agree that it’s a damn good thing that adultery was decriminalised.\\nIf Catholic Malta has Catholic laws, then this makes us a theocracy and not a democracy. Islamic shariah states are theocracies, and we regard them with contempt for being unable to differentiate between the laws of God and the laws of the secular state. And here we are, insisting that Malta does the same. Oh, but the religion is different, so that’s OK then.\\nThe people who think like this have no imagination. But if they had imagination, would they be such Bible-bashers? The real reason that the Catholic Church opposes divorce is not because of the ending of the marriage per se – after all, it has no objection to separation, which has precisely the same effect of parting the married couple. No, the Catholic Church objects because if you divorce, then you are likely to remarry, and in the eyes of the church, that constitutes adultery. So the reason the Catholic Church fights against divorce is because of the ‘sin’ Marlene Pullicino is committing in the first place. Whether she divorces or not, the religion she claims to fervently believe in and practise deems her to be living in a state of mortal sin, unable to receive the sacraments. So I think we can take any ‘I am a Catholic’ statements from that quarter with a jar full of salt.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe criminal defence lawyer Giannella Caruana Curran wrote this letter to The Times on behalf of St Michael’s independent school in Tal-Balal, trying to defend the court ban on the publication of the school’s name. At least she spared us any attempt at trying to defend the ban on Mark Vella Gera’s name, though that could be for the simple reason that he is not her client and in this case, the school is.\\nFunnily enough, the exact same letter, word for word, was carried in The Malta Independent on the same day, but signed rather enigmatically by somebody called simply ‘School Principal’. What school principal? Oh of course, after an entire letter which discusses a school while failing to mention its name, the school principal could hardly put her name, or the name of the school, to the letter. This is the full extent of the farce into which the court’s decision has tipped us.\\nAs for Dr Caruana Curran’s pronouncements, from the other side of the fence this time, I would have been more inclined to bless them with credibility had she not been one of the lawyers defending the priests who molested small boys at St Joseph’s Home. It’s a free country and prominent defence lawyers are free to take up any brief that comes their way. That’s what they’re there for. But as public figures, they have to understand that they are as answerable for their actions and their choices as the next man (or woman).\\nFortunately, St Joseph Home is now run by a very decent chap, but that doesn’t stop us wanting to know what’s happening in the mysteriously-disappearing-from-public-view trial of the molesters. That trial has been wrapped in a blanket of secrecy and silence because of a total ban on the publication of anything to do with it. The result is that we don’t even know whether it is happening, or whether it has equally mysteriously slipped out of the system.\\nThat’s one reason why these bans are wrong-headed. They serve no interests but those of the perpetrators. We cannot see whether justice is being done, and when the case is concluded, if it is ever concluded, we will be unable to see whether justice has been done. The law clearly states that bans only apply while the trial/case is in progress, and that they do not apply at its conclusion. But how do we know when the case is concluded when we do not even know for certain that it is happening?\\nSaturday, 26th April 2008\\nCyber abuse case\\nGiannella Caruana Curran, Advocate, Valletta.\\nI am instructed by the principal of the school that reported a case of cyber abuse by a former casual teacher who was eventually found guilty of the charges brought against him, to correct some misleading information published in certain sections of the media (not The Times) regarding the case in question and to set the record straight.\\nThe facts were as follows:\\n1. The cyber abuse case in question happened when the person responsible was not a teacher at the school. In fact he only taught there for one term and this was in the year 2007.\\n2. The seven children contacted via internet were all from the senior school and none from the junior school, as has been erroneously stated or implied in certain media reports.\\n3. Immediately upon the school becoming aware of contact being made by this ex-teacher and a few of its students the school authorities took immediate action by informing the parents involved and held meetings with the children concerned. They did everything in their power to make sure that the abuse would be definitely stopped and the perpetrator brought to justice.\\nThis they did by giving all the details and information to Inspector P. Caruana from the Cyber Crime Unit, and Inspector Louise Calleja from the Vice Squad, in order to ensure the arrest of the perpetrator. In fact it was thanks to the immediate action taken by the school and the police authorities that the abuse was not only stopped, but within 48 hours the man was investigated, arraigned in court and sentenced.\\n4. The school authorities, and this also in pursuance of its policy on internet safety for students, immediately organised a talk for all the parents and students of the school, inviting as guest speakers people from the Cyber Crime and Vice Squad Units together with a representative from Appoġġ. This talk is scheduled to be held next Tuesday.\\n5. The court presumably deemed fit a ban on publication of the school’s name in order to make it harder for the names of the minors involved to be known. In this way it also protects those very minors’ vulnerability. The ban also protects the other students of the same school from being picked on or slandered by students of other schools. It is also correct to protect the reputation of a school or institution which has done nothing wrong but only instigated and helped in the prosecution of the wrongdoer in order that he be stopped and brought to justice.\\nFurthermore the mantle of anonymity of the school and the children will encourage other persons or institutions to come forward to help the police in their investigations, thus helping to ensure the prosecution of paedophiles and other criminals without the fear of any negative publicity or exposure of their students and themselves.\\nThe court decided on the ban of the name of the minors and the school in the best interest of the victims involved, the other children attending the same school and the name of the school. This the court did as a result of its experience in such matters, in order to encourage victims to come forward.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe case of Nicholas Azzopardi is the talk of the town. His death-bed allegation that he was beaten up by police and later woke from a coma in a hospital bed has the ring of truth about it. At that stage, Azzopardi didn’t know he was going to die. His death was unexpected. So he said what he did knowing that he would have to substantiate it.\\nThis dreadful incident hits home because it has echoes of the past. It also has echoes of the present, in other police interrogation cells elsewhere. We know that these things happen, because they have happened in Malta and they happen in other places still.\\nThe instant reaction to that story when it broke was not ‘Oh, the man’s a liar’, but ‘My God, he must be telling the truth.’ That wasn’t just my reaction. It was the reaction of almost everyone I spoke to. Past experience and present knowledge have conditioned us to expect this kind of thing. Going in for questioning is like disappearing into a black hole for the next 24 hours or so. It’s just you and the police, with no lawyer present.\\nThen the police issued a statement and police sources spoke to the newspapers, and that had the ring of truth about it, too. So who to believe? I’m not going to pronounce myself on this one, because from what I’ve read and heard so far, both sides of the story are equally credible and I just don’t know whose ‘truth’ to take on board, which is unusual for me.\\nI don’t think the police would just start beating somebody up, especially not over something as mundane as what seems to be a case of two estranged parents quarrelling over the kids and one accusing the other of molestation, apparently out of spite though not necessarily so. The police deal with these cases all the time as one marriage after another hit the rocks and the grown-ups involved end up behaving as anything but.\\nThen again, if Azzopardi – a heavily-built man depicted in press photographs wearing muscle-revealing vests – reacted physically to police taunts, I can well imagine that one of those present at the interrogation lashed out and literally made a hash of things, landing the police officers present in the room with a very serious problem that they might have solved in the worst possible manner. But then again, with the way the police force is run now, it would have been very difficult to haul a heavy and still conscious man out of the depot without anyone else noticing, still less heft him over the bastion.\\nIf it did happen, we are talking about a major conspiracy of silence in the police force, and doubt nags at the back of my mind when I look at this rationally. Trust in the police force has improved, and with good reason. If this had happened 25 years ago, we would have had no doubt that the police did it, but things have changed, which makes me reluctant to rush to judgement. I have deep misgivings about the case either way.\\nThe retired judge Albert Manche, who has been put in charge of the inquiry, is not one to be trifled with. He is a man to be trusted – though unfortunately, he will be handicapped by the fact that Magistrate Anthony Vella (the same one who banned publication of the name of the teacher who sent sexy text messages to his pupils, incidentally) didn’t see fit to record his death-bed questioning of Nicholas Azzopardi. Let’s hope he took notes at least.\\nMy purpose here is to point out that this kind of bad thing only happens because our interrogation rules are those of a despotic regime, in which it is possible to beat and torture people at the police depot, or to put lies into their mouths, because there are no regulatory controls. The only controls we have now are entirely discretionary. They are based on good will.\\nI have written about this already: that it is appalling how the interrogation system the police use today remains entirely unchanged from the days when I and others were interrogated by Anglu Farrugia and his cronies in the 1980s. Those who are interrogated are not permitted even one telephone call to let their family know where they are. They just ‘disappear’ for the next 48 hours. They are not permitted legal counsel. They are not even permitted to telephone their lawyer. They are not told their rights, because quite frankly, they haven’t any. They are left floundering, quizzed in an unequal battle of wits between experienced detectives and those who have never been in such a situation before. Hardened criminals know how to handle things, but what of the rest?\\nI can well remember my own experience with Anglu Farrugia, which I have written about before, but it bears repeating, if only to annoy him: forced to sign a falsified confession which he typed while putting words in my mouth, after keeping me in total darkness for 27 hours, in a tiny cell with what smelled like excrement on the walls, with no water, and just one filthy sandwich, no access to a lawyer and no contact with anyone outside that notorious high gate.\\nBecause I was a bit sharper than the average 19-year-old, certainly sharper than Farrugia, in any case, I used my boring time in that cell to work out a plan of action. I would let him write whatever he wanted to in my ‘statement’. I would agree to everything he said, even GBH on a policeman twice my size. Then I would sign the statement so that he would allow me to leave, and kick up a major fuss about it in court.\\nI knew that forced confessions didn’t count for zilch and that the whole thing would rebound on him, which it did. It is still rebounding on him today. Not everyone knows this, and it is not always possible to think clearly under such duress. I remember being very, very calm and thinking very, very clearly – but then I have broken down and flipped out in much less stressful situations. Heaven help anyone who flips out in a police interrogation, and not because of physical violence, either – but because if you say something ill-advised, you can end up with serious problems.\\nI find it incredible that in this day and age, when we are supposedly civilised, we continue to allow a situation in which people who are questioned by the police under detention have no access to a lawyer, and that the questioning is neither recorded, nor videotaped, nor even conducted in a room with a viewing-chamber or viewing-window that exposes the proceedings to authorised persons.\\nPlease explain to me how it can be considered in any way safe or risk-free or even advisable to put a detained person in a closed room with police officers who are questioning him or her, with no scrutiny and no record of what is said or done. It is a recipe for disaster, a giant problem waiting to happen. And now it has happened. A man is dead and the police are being blamed for it. It is because our interrogation procedures have not kept pace with those of the civilised world that this has occurred. If Nicholas Azzopardi’s interrogation had been conducted formally, audiotaped, videotaped, scrutinised and with his lawyer present, then none of this would have happened. But when you interrogate somebody as though you are operating in Zimbabwe, calling him in and then causing him to disappear into a secluded room with police officers, you are asking for trouble. And when you ask for trouble, you usually get it.\\nWe are so accustomed to watching British detective series on the television that we imagine this is the way interrogations are conducted in Malta. Two police officers sit across the table from you, and your lawyer sits by your side. A tape recorder sits on the table and the interrogating officer speaks the time into it and takes note of whoever leaves or enters the room, or any other physical movement that is untoward. The lawyer advises his client whether to answer or not answer certain questions. I have been told that one of the first things that people do when called in for questioning at our Police Depot is to ask for their lawyer, only to be met with a raised eyebrow. They assume, because of all their watching of detective films, that they have a right to a lawyer while under interrogation. Well, here’s some news for you: you have no more right to a lawyer now than you did in Police Commissioner Lorry Pullicino’s day. Nothing has changed since then.\\nMy favourite government minister Tonio Borg had promised to do something about this when he was Minister of Justice. Instead, he dedicated the time to writing to floral clubs and jiu-jitsu associations, using his power of incumbency to get them to support Paul Vincenti’s whacko petition to have the fact that Malta is against abortion slotted into our Constitution. That was more important than making sure that people are never put into a position where they are immediately vulnerable to beatings and abuse by any interrogating officer who may be so inclined.\\nNone of Tonio Borg’s predecessors in the justice ministry did anything about it, either. Now, with this case, we have reached the point of no return. Something has to be done about it. Even if it turns out that Nicholas Azzopardi died as a result of trying to escape rather than because of a police beating, this case should teach Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, Borg’s successor, and the police commissioner that we cannot afford to let this state of affairs go on.\\nWe need the British system of controlled and monitored police interrogation, and we need it now. The police say that it hinders their objectives. Well, they would, wouldn’t they? But nothing hinders your objectives more than a national scandal in which a man dies after claiming grievous bodily harm by the police.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nLook, you all know by now that I have a thing about appropriate clothing, and I do try to control myself not to appear unduly obsessed. But really, there are limits.\\nLook at this line-up of leadership hopefuls on May Day, for example. Not to put too fine a point on it, what in heaven’s name do some of these people think they’re wearing? The only ones who have followed the rule that you should dress for the job you want and not for the job you have are George Abela, who got it perfectly right with a dark suit, dark shoes and plain tie, and Michael Falzon – except that a dark suit would have been a much better choice than a pale one.\\nThen we have Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, wearing a cheap black trouser-suit from the 1980s – totally out of fashion, devoid of style and completely unflattering – with a red scoop-neck top that doesn’t exactly harmonise with her jacket-lapels (pavri), nothing round her neck, and what appear to be flip-flops. She’s on the short side, so they might very well have a heel attached, in which case we will have to call them thong-sandals. Whatever they are, they are completely unsuitable because (1) they don’t chime with the 1980s suit and (2) bare toes at a May Day parade are a no-no for somebody seeking to become party leader and prime minister.\\nThen we have Joseph Muscat, obviously thinking he’s hip and that he’s rocking an edgy look. He seems to have taken his own famous advice on board: that the more important you are, the more casually you can dress. Yes, I know he’s wrong, so don’t all rush at me at once. Dressing inappropriately may be possible when you’re important, but it remains atrocious manners all the same, which is why, for example, the president of the United States or Queen Elizabeth I would never have turned up at a formal ceremony at which the head of state was present wearing casual garb, as Roberto Benigni did in Malta. If you do something like that, it doesn’t reveal your significance and importance, but your lack of good breeding. Essentially, what you are saying is: I am more important than you are. I am even more important than your president. Therefore he turns up in a suit, but I don’t have to do so.\\nBut back to Muscat, who’s rocking the edgy look (he thinks). So he’s gone for an open-necked shirt. Fine, but he needs to be told how to wear it. So here goes: if you’re going to opt for separates rather than a suit, make sure that the separates really do look separate. If they are as close in tone as what you’re wearing in this picture, Joseph, you end up looking as though you pulled out what you thought was a suit at 6am when you couldn’t see straight.\\nAs for those brown shoes – oh God. Oh God. Oh God again. What is it with Joseph and Jason and their brown shoes? There is one very important reason, apart from the dictates of style and the male sartorial code, why you should never wear brown shoes with black trousers especially if you have short legs: they make your legs look even shorter. Black shoes with black trousers create an uninterrupted visual line from hip to toe. Brown shoes with black trousers chop your legs off at the ankle and emphasise their lack of length.\\nNow for Evarist – what is he? Tal-Muzew? All he needs is one of those little badges at his neck and we’ll all start snatching our children away from him (that was a joke, before the obsessed begin to write in). Seriously though, I did say that he reminds me of a nun when he speaks on television, now here he is, dressed as a priest or some kind of lay religious person in at least three shades of black and charcoal. What a mess.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, May 3rd, 2008 at 1:16 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nFew people know that if you circulate slanderous or libellous emails about others you expose yourself to investigation by the police and to possible prosecution. I’m not saying this to put the fear of God (or the police) into you. I’m saying it to point out that what you might think is a bit of harmless fun or gossip is actually a criminal act.\\nYes, spreading harmful lies about people by email is a criminal act. And so it should be. It is not freedom of expression but an act of moral violence perpetrated on a person who is left without the proper means to fight back and undo the damage. Some lies are harmless, yes. Others are clearly a joke and should be laughed off unless you are totally devoid of a sense of humour. But other lies are very, very damaging indeed, especially when they are given the ring of truth so that others may believe them.\\nAs the victim of precisely this kind of lying slander during the election campaign, I have particularly strong feelings about it. I have been written about, criticised, carped at and laughed at for nigh on 20 years, and it doesn’t bother me in the slightest. But I draw the line at malicious lies, about me or anybody else. And that’s why I never circulate slanderous emails. I don’t think it’s a bit of a laugh. I think it’s horrible.\\nThere are a couple of PDF documents doing the rounds right now that purport to be exchanges of emails between Kevin Decesare and Jason Micallef, and between Kevin Decesare and Mark Micallef, a journalist with The Times. They are an attempt at shifting the blame for the leaking of the Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando story to the Labour Party onto Kevin Decesare, who has denied this from day one. He is now thinking of going to the police as the emails continue to do their rounds.\\nIn one set of emails, Kevin gives Jason the story and Jason promises him a permit in return. This is slanderous to both of them, and my sheer dislike of Jason doesn’t stop me seeing that and won’t stop me saying it. In the other set of emails, Kevin promises Mark Micallef a bribe for running a story, and Mark Micallef replies ‘Call me’. Mark is horrified and is at a loss how to clear his name. What does he do? Put out a press release saying that he does not take bribes? The situation is appalling.\\nRead the pdfs here: fredu.pdf and kevin.pdf.\\nThe emails are fake – not just fake, but clearly, obviously fake. As soon as I read them, I knew that there was no way on earth that Kevin Decesare, who comes from exactly the same linguistic group that I do – for want of a better description – could have written them. The linguistic clues that the emails were faked by somebody who is not a tal-pepe Sliema boy in his mid-40s who went to St Edward’s (sorry, Kevin) and who speaks exactly as I do leapt right off the screen and into my face. Others, who may not come from the same linguistic group – or who do, but who are unaware that Kevin Decesare does, too – will believe this slander. And that’s why it’s dangerous and criminal.\\nBased purely on linguistic usage, I would hazard a (pretty accurate, I think) guess that the person who faked these emails is a man aged between the mid-20s and early 30s, from a lower middle-class or aspirational working-class background, who is unfamiliar with the linguistic usage of people like Kevin and so is unable to mimic it accurately enough that people like me, who come from the same linguistic group, do not pick up the clues. The profile of the person who faked these emails is exactly the same, I would say, as that of the people who write for and produce the Labour Party’s website www.maltastar.com. The linguistic usage is identical. I am not saying it is them. I repeat that I am not saying it is them. They would have no interest in slandering Jason Micallef. I am saying that the linguistic usage is identical and that the profile of the person is likely to be identical too – the same profile I described above.\\nI think that what we are looking at here is a situation in which the person who really was responsible for Alfred Sant getting hold of that contract – through his carelessness with copies, I would say, rather than through deliberate sabotage – is trying to shift the blame and exculpate himself by landing somebody else in the s**t. There were only two copies of that contract besides the one safely locked under great security in the notary’s office, and one of them was in Pullicino Orlando’s hands. But that’s beside the point. The point is that somebody has faked emails that slander a prominent person with a reputation to protect, the secretary-general of a political party, and a respected journalist with an important newspaper. The emails are being mass-mailed around Malta. My son received one today, through the Amazonia e-mailing list, on which there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people his age, many of whom will not know Kevin Decesare or Mark Micallef from a tomato, and who will be predisposed to believe that the exchange of emails is real.\\nHere are some excerpts from ‘Kevin’s’ emails that he would never have written, no more than I would have.\\n1. “I have a scoop that with it the PN will surly lose the 8th March general election. As I told the leader before today here are some of the facts.”\\n‘I have a scoop that with it’ – this is the syntax used by people who speak English as a poorly-learned second language. This person doesn’t know the difference in meaning between ‘surly’ and ‘surely’, and because his spell-check wouldn’t have picked it up, he didn’t either. Also, Kevin would have said ‘the election’ (as I do) and not ‘the 8th March general election’, and he would never have said ‘as I told the leader’, but ‘as I told Alfred Sant’, because he knows him on a personal basis, as does Jason. They are discussing somebody they both know personally. Even if he didn’t know Sant personally, the very thought of Kevin Decesare talking about ‘the leader’ makes me double up.\\n2. “A permit was issued to built a disco”\\nI think Kevin knows the difference between built and build.\\n3. “the architect of this project is nobody but ‘Paul Camilleri’ Lawrence Gonzi Prime cousin”\\nThis is a dead give-away that the writer is somebody who is thinking in Maltese (Kevin thinks in English), and who is so unfamiliar with English that he has translated ‘prim kugin’ as ‘prime cousin’ rather than as first cousin, like those people who use ‘niece’ and ‘nephew’ when they mean ‘grandson’ and ‘grand-daughter’ because the word in Maltese is the same for both kinds of relationship – ‘neputi’ and ‘neputija.\\nThe writer is also the sort of person who puts names in inverted commas for suggestive emphasis, but if I tell you what sort of people I think do this, you’ll rush up at me with accusations of snobbery, so I won’t.\\n4. “he can fit about 4000 persons for sure”\\nThat ‘for sure’ is a give-away with bells on. It’s used by wannabes trying to mimic tal-pepe people and getting it wrong. A tal-pepe person would split the infinitive and say “he can definitely fit about 4000 people (not persons) there”\\n5. “These are the points I managed to get for now. My architect is working on it to have more detailed information and I will be forward everything to you to give to our leader. Besides my notary is checking for us to whom the land belong to.”\\nAaaarrrrgghhhh! Hopeless – I don’t even need to explain this one to you. But in case the faker is reading this, I’ll explain what Kevin would have written, because it’s no different to what I’d have written myself: “This is all I’ve got for now. My architect is trying to get hold of more information. I’ll send it to you when I’ve got it, and you can pass it on to Dr Sant. Meanwhile, my notary is trying to find out who owns the land.” Spot the difference.\\n6. “our deals will no longer be secured”\\nThis has been written by somebody who has no idea that ‘deals’ are not ‘secured’ on the basis of the presence or absence of competition. He probably doesn’t even know that it is loans, not deals, that are secured, or what security means in these terms as opposed to ‘feeling secure’.\\n7. “Land in question belong to a PN MP”\\nOh for heaven’s sake, I don’t have to explain to you what’s wrong with this one. All I know is that Kevin Decesare is going to be teased for months by people walking up to him and speaking in semi-pidgin about Our Leader.\\n8. “I believe that thousands of money were surly paid”\\nThere’s that ‘surly’ again. Where I come from, we say ‘he must have paid thousands’. Thousands of money? As opposed to what – thousands of potatoes?\\n9. “Make sure my name is not mentioned nowhere”\\nOh dear, a double negative that’s a clue with flashing lights on it. The Vickie Pollards of Malta strike again. Anywhere, you dunce! Anywhere! This would have been written by the kind of person who says ‘I didn’t go nowhere’, because the Maltese equivalent is ‘ma mort mkien’ (I didn’t go nowhere). Again, the person is thinking in Maltese and translating into English – don’t mention me mkien (nowhere).\\n10. “Make high effort as I cannot compete with this design”\\nMake high effort? I have to make a high effort to keep a straight face.\\n11. “At least I gain time”\\nI wish you could see my face right now. This was written by the same kind of person who says ‘don’t mention me nowhere’, and who can’t distinguish between the present tense and the future in English because Maltese, in the translation of that sentence, uses exactly the same verb for the present and the future.\\n12.”Stopping this project will surely (spelt right for the first time) mean that our co-operations (plural) will get closer and our arrangements will increase for sure”\\nYes, definitely the profile of the kind of person I described somewhere up above. I’m not saying it to disparage that kind of person. I’m just pointing out that it can’t possibly be Kevin Decesare, no more than it could be me writing that.\\nSo please, if you’re one of those people circulating these emails because you think they’re real, or because you think it’s just a bit of fun, don’t. Stop it. What you are doing is wrong and dangerous.\\n  \\n\\n\\nfredu\\n\\n\\nkevin\\n\\n  \\n\\nLuuuuuuuuurve the white pants, Jason\\nYou know how the language messes of the ‘common man’ are forced on the rest of us as proper usage – like ‘pirmli’ for ‘pilloli’ and ‘blekbort’ for ‘blackboard’? Well, here’s another one: the confusion between making an apology and asking for one. Those at the vanguard of the fight for the Maltese language don’t seem to know the difference and – oh irony of ironies – must have this difference explained to them by the person they mock for her lack of knowledge of the language (little do they know what a lot of light there is beneath this bushel). The bright lights of the Maltese language have decided that when a person apologises, what he does is ‘jitlob apologija’. See the Charles Mangion speech report from L-orizzont, below.\\nSorry, boys, but you’re right off target. Asking for an apology doesn’t mean that you’re apologising to others. It means that you’re asking others to apologise to you.\\nThe concept of apologising does not exist in Maltese culture, and so the equivalent word does not exist in the Maltese language. Instead, we have the concept and the phrase for asking for forgiveness (nitlob li tahfirli/tahfruli). We have adopted a romance word to accommodate the concept of begging pardon (nitlob skuza), and the closest we can get to apologising is ‘niskuza ruhi’. Some people say ‘nappologizza’, but I think that’s horribly inelegant and clunky.\\nSo I’m going to spell it out again to the reporters at L-orizzont:\\nJITLOB APOLOGIJA DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE APOLOGISED. IT MEANS THAT HE ASKED FOR AN APOLOGY (FROM SOMEBODY ELSE).\\nHave you got that on board? Right – now tell us more about Jason Micallef’s white pants.\\n\\nJitlob apoloġija għall-iżbalji li wettaq\\nQabel temm id-diskors tiegħu, Charles Mangion qal li fuq nota personali, id-deċiżjoni li ma jikkontesta għat-tmexxija tal-Partit Laburista kienet waħda personali u qal li din id-deċiżjoni m’ghandhiex tinfthiem li mhux se jibqa’ jaħdem fil-Partit Laburista bħalma ilu jagħmel għal dawn l-aħħar 30 sena.\\nHuwa ammetta li saru żbalji, fosthom li l-messaġġ tal-Partit Laburista ma twassalx kif ried il-partit fl-aħħar elezzjoni u għal dawn huwa talab apoloġija.

This is concurrent with the standard magisterial inquiry, which takes place each time there is a serious crime or when foul play is suspected, even if there is no death involved. The two inquiries are separate, have a distinct identity, and serve different purposes.\\nThe use of the term ‘independent inquiry’ is rather unfortunate. The magisterial inquiry is independent too. The purpose of both inquiries is to sort out the facts from the lies, the exaggerations, the half-truths and the figments of imagination. For example, it is being suggested in some quarters that the man’s death in hospital, when he had been talking and watching television just a short while before, is mysterious. Yet medical sources say that after his physical trauma the risk of an embolism was high. The suggestion that Nicholas Azzopardi was killed by those who didn’t wish him to speak may seem far-fetched (but still has to be investigated). The suggestion that he was not given the appropriate preventive treatment for an embolism or thrombus is not far-fetched. This means that a third inquiry – an internal inquiry at the State hospital – is essential.\\nThe government’s independent inquiry is being conducted within the context and scope of the government’s administrative responsibility for the police force. Put simply, the government needs to find out what went wrong in this department for which it is wholly responsible. It needs to know what controls must be put in place to avoid the same thing happening again, whether it was a beating, an escape attempt, or something else. The purpose of this inquiry is not to find out whether somebody should be prosecuted or not. Judge Manche will report directly to the government with his findings, and the government, because of the separation of powers which so few people seem to understand, is in no position to order that X or Y should be prosecuted.\\nThese are Judge Manche’s terms of reference in the independent inquiry: to examine the behaviour of the police towards Nicholas Azzopardi, from the moment he was called in for questioning to his death in hospital; to find out whether there was any dereliction of duty or abuse of power by the police; to report on any ancillary matters related to the forgoing; and, to make recommendations based on his conclusions.\\nThe magisterial inquiry is something else altogether. The magistrate’s terms of reference are to report on the situation so that the attorney-general has all the facts to hand when deciding whether to prosecute somebody or not. It is a routine exercise, and not an extraordinary one, despite the extraordinary nature of the case. There are magisterial inquiries all the time. When our house was set on fire, for example, there was a magisterial inquiry. When somebody is knocked down and badly injured in a hit-and-run crash, there is a magisterial inquiry. When that poor woman fell into a well in her yard and died a couple of weeks ago, there was a magisterial inquiry. Those are just some examples.\\nThe magistrate who heads this inquiry appoints experts to assist him or her, and then writes a report which is submitted not to the government, but to the attorney-general. The attorney-general then decides on the appropriate course of action. It is the attorney-general, and not the government, who will decide whether to prosecute anyone in this case or not. The prime minister, the minister of justice, nor even the police commissioner can tell him what to do. That’s the separation of powers.\\nThe Nicholas Azzopardi case has permutations which demand more than the usual magisterial inquiry. The people who are responsible for the police need to know what to do about the situation. To draw a simple comparison, if something goes wrong in a factory or another place of work and a customer dies in extraordinary circumstances, the owners of the company – if they have their heads screwed on right – don’t say “Oh, we’ll wait for the outcome of the magisterial inquiry, and then we’ll decide what to do.” No. They’ll set up their own internal inquiry to see where they went wrong and how to avoid it happening again, because the motivation and purpose of the magisterial inquiry are different from their own motivation and purpose.\\nDespite these clear differences, the Chamber of Advocates has put a question mark over the proceedings, wondering out loud why the government has set up an independent inquiry. The chamber is objecting, apparently, because of the risk that the findings of the government’s independent inquiry may be different to those of the magisterial inquiry.\\nTry as I might, I fail to follow this train of thought. What the Chamber of Advocates appears to be saying is that the government shouldn’t hold its own inquiry because it might discover things that the magisterial inquiry failed to find out, or vice versa. How is this problematic? Granted, it would be a public relations problem for the people involved if the two inquiries drew different conclusions or reported different facts, but it is certainly not a public interest problem for the people out here.\\nHowever, I try to interpret what the chamber said, I keep coming back to the words that ignorance is bliss. Even though the inquiries have purposes that are entirely different, they still act as a control on each other – or rather, as a control on the people who will be questioned. You can lie and cover up to one inquiry, but it’s a whole lot more difficult to carry your story through two different inquiries. The Chamber of Advocates doesn’t like this. But then the Chamber of Advocates has never liked any boats to be rocked, even if rocking them is in the public interest.\\nThe chamber might not be too thrilled to discover that its views are shared by none other than Malta’s favourite former police superintendent. Anglu Farrugia, who continues to masquerade as Labour’s spokesman for justice, has told the government that it is “irresponsible” for setting up an independent inquiry.\\nIrresponsible? The Minister of Justice would have been irresponsible if he had washed his hands of the matter and shoved the ball into the Magistrate’s court. I’m sorry about those mixed metaphors, but sometimes they come in handy, especially when talking about people with mixed thinking, like Anglu Farrugia.\\nI’m tempted to say that Dr Farrugia is a fine one to be talking about irresponsibility, but I don’t really want to drag up his history in the police force again. So instead I’ll refer to recent history and his Pink Panther attempts at hunting down the secret agents who bought the votes of drug-addled Labour supporters for e70, putting an illegitimate government into power.\\nAnglu Farrugia has asked the Minister of Justice to explain himself. I can hear Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici sighing all the way from where I am sitting. That’s the trouble with people like Dr Farrugia. They don’t seem to understand that the most common reaction they provoke is a deep sigh of exasperation. They see themselves as campaigners for right and reason, when really they are no more than exasperating circus acts.\\nDr Farrugia is a lawyer. He is a politician. He is the shadow spokesman for justice. He was a senior police officer for many years. He is perfectly qualified and equipped to understand the differences between the nature and purpose of the two separate inquiries. But he is unable to do so. And yet I, with none of that background, can. This is not because I am Stephen Hawking. It’s because Anglu Farrugia – well, let’s not go into any great detail here. All you need to do is visit his website, www.anglufarrugia.com, and you’ll see what I mean. Don’t forget to check out the photo-gallery. It will make your Sunday.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nToni Abela was interviewed by Malta Today (it’s in today’s edition) and came up with a brilliant plan to raise funds for the near-bankrupt Labour Party. Right. Hold your breath. He thinks Labour supermarkets for Labour supporters will be an amazingly good idea.\\n“If we have a market of 200,000 Labourites….the party can become a provider of services and commodities,” he told his interviewer. And supermarkets? “Why not? Why shouldn’t a political party fare as well as a private operator does when they open a shop? I want our supporters to become stakeholders in this operation. I am saying that what others can do, we can do better.” So not just a Labour supermarket then, but a Labour supermarket with shares sold to Labour supporters.\\nWhat can I say? I’m speechless (very unusual). The man knows nothing about business, and probably even less about running a political party. Now he wants to sell nuts to raise funds to pay for Super One. He doesn’t even know that you can’t plunder the revenue of a limited liability company to finance the operations of something else altogether, otherwise you’ll end up like the most notorious supermarket of all, Price Club.\\nA business is a business, Toni. You run it as a going concern driven by the profit motive, not as a fund-raising exercise to keep a political party’s television afloat and to pay the secretary-general’s salary to keep him in white pants and beige suits for funerals.\\nAnd to think that 140,000+ people voted for this bunch of no-hopers to run the country. Dear God, what a narrow escape we had.\\nToni Abela isn’t going to stand for election to parliament. Oh no. He’s just going to stand for election as deputy leader, so that he can implement his plans for a Labour supermarket that will continue to polarise the nation and bankrupt the party. You don’t have to be in parliament to change the world, he told Malta Today, citing the example of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Well, what a t**ser. Not only does he know nothing about business and the management of political parties, but he knows even less about history. The very two people he mentioned couldn’t even have been elected to parliament (or the US equivalent) if they wanted to. They were both fighting for civil rights and for autonomy for their people, because they didn’t have either.\\nThe man’s embarrassing, but what is even more cringe-making than his idiotic utterances is Malta Today’s description of him as:\\nA freethinking intellectual with a pugnacious sense of humour, a prolific writer and an orator of no mean thespian skill, he might have been Malta’s closest equivalent to Roberto Benigni, had he not chosen politics as his calling.\\nRoberto Benigni – that skinny little Italian court jester with the ‘I trip and you laugh’ sense of humour – leaves me stone cold except for the overwhelming desire to get on a steam-roller and mow him flat. But even I can see that he’s about as similar to Toni Abela as Roman Abramovic’s business sense is to Toni’s. Freethinking intellectual? Pugnacious sense of humour? How about crass sense of humour? And he is a prolific writer, yes – of vulgar innuendos and inane articles for L-orizzont. Very impressive. As for his oratorical and thespian skills, whenever I see him hard at work on Super One, I always think how well he would have done in one of those touring circuses that put on miracle plays for the peasants in the Middle Ages, all exaggerated movements, simple jokes and deliberate pronunciation.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Sunday, May 4th, 2008 at 5:17 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nLast Sunday I wrote about the immense difference that the spring hunting laws have made to the number of birds in our garden, and that for the past weeks their twittering has been so loud that it’s like sitting in an aviary. For the past few days I’ve been hearing one call that stood out from the rest, then finally I saw the source in flashes of bright yellow and greenish-yellow between one tree and another – a golden oriole, the first I have ever seen in almost two decades living here. Here’s a picture (a stock image, not ‘our’ bird) so that you can what it looks like.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe Labour Party and its website Maltastar.com are speaking in a scandalised tone about the appointment of the Nationalist Party’s former information secretary to the post of head of government communications. They say that this is a partisan move which ‘proves’ that the prime minister does not mean what he says about running a government for all the people.\\nUnfortunately, George Abela has joined in with these rubbish arguments. I prefer to think that it’s because he doesn’t know Gordon Pisani at work, rather than because he wants to do as Maltastar does and try to score a cheap point.\\nThe head of government communications is there to do a proper job, and not to be a symbol of political unity among the people. It is a difficult job and a highly specialised one. More to the point, he will be communicating and explaining government policy, and the government is Nationalist not Labour or ‘I don’t know’. This is not a job for a neutral civil servant, but for a political appointee – not just in Malta but almost everywhere else.\\nVery few people in this country can do that kind of job, though many think they can. In my own line of work, I am forever meeting people who are appointed to posts they cannot possibly hope to fill, doing jobs while being blissfully unaware of how far short of the required skills level they repeatedly fall. Standards are low, good people are hard to find, and individuals are slotted into jobs for which they are not qualified.\\nIn Gordon Pisani, the government has found the right person for the job. I mean that, and you had better take my word for it, because media and communications are the fields in which I have worked for years. I have seen a long parade of incompetents in my time, including men who can barely cobble a paragraph together bluffing their way from one meeting to another while getting nothing done and trying to look more clever than everyone else. They are the ones who are largely responsible for shaping my feminist outlook.\\nThe thing about the Nationalist Party, which the Labour Party fails repeatedly to understand, is that part of the secret of its effectiveness lies in finding the best people for important jobs within the party structure. Like him or dislike him, Joe Saliba is certainly not Jason Micallef, and the Nationalist Party would never, and I mean never, have appointed somebody like Jason Micallef to that crucial organisational role. Gordon Pisani was a highly effective information secretary, responsible for much of the success of this last electoral campaign, the previous one, and the referendum campaign. You can always depend on me to notice that somebody is a useless ass, and to point this out. Gordon Pisani, on the other hand, struck me for being extremely good at his job.\\nI like him for another reason (which reason also makes him good at his job): he notices everything and says nothing. Extracting words from Gordon is like pulling teeth. He won’t say anything unless it is a very pointed observation. As a person of very few (spoken) words myself, I appreciate this quality. Also, I absolutely can’t stand those blah-blah-blah bluffer men who are all talk and hardly any brains. I just want to put a rocket under them. I’ve noticed on my journey through life that the people who talk most notice least. It’s hard to observe things when you’re busy yak-yakking and your mind is on trying to bluff and impress.\\nGordon Pisani was an excellent information secretary for the Nationalist Party and he will be an excellent head of communications for the government. He is perfectly qualified for the job, and to be straightforwardly honest, I can’t think of anyone else who is equally well-suited to the role, even though I know so many people in the communications business. Serving as head of government communications requires you to have all the skills of a media professional in the private sector, but also considerable experience in political structures and a certain level of political expertise and astuteness. Above all, Gordon Pisani is a very, very nice chap and completely devoid of that insufferable back-stabbing spite that you find so often in political people.\\nGiven the choice between somebody from the private sector who hasn’t half a clue but who will not be perceived as ‘political’, and somebody all-clued-up like Gordon Pisani, the government did the right thing in picking Gordon. The most important thing – in government as in business – is that the job is done well by the person best qualified to do it, and not whether the Labour Party and Maltastar.com approve or not. Who cares what they think, when they are so bad at choosing the right people to do the many jobs in their own show?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nNow why does he put me in mind of the junior account executive at an advertising agency, pitching an idea at a board meeting while everyone else humours him? Or one of those insufferable altar-boys delivering a well-rehearsed priedka tat-tifel?\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe way the Labour Party and its various adjuncts are going on, you’d think that the last general election was a draw and that the Nationalist Party is governing only with the express permission of the Labour Party, and on sufferance. Malta’s little section of cyberspace is brimful of comments by those who seem to believe that the government cannot appoint anyone to a key position without a by-your-leave from the Labour Party. And who in the Labour Party would make that decision, in any case, given that it remains rudderless until early June?\\nBut that’s not the point. The point is that in general elections, as with almost everything else in life, a miss is as good as a mile. It makes no sense for the Labour Party to argue that it almost won, because a near win is nothing more than a complete and absolute loss. Whether Labour lost by 1500 votes or 15 votes makes no difference at all. It lost. That’s it. The Nationalist Party is not required, morally or otherwise, to share the seat of government or to appoint representatives of the Opposition to key positions that are within its gift.\\nThe ‘we almost won’ mentality is being hyped up by the pro-Labour media. The general tone is ‘iss hej, it’s not fair; we almost won but they’re not letting us take part in running the show.’ Does this make sense? Of course it doesn’t. What the Labour Party is talking about here is a virtual coalition of sorts, based on the fact that it obtained a mere 1500 votes fewer than the Nationalist Party. But our democratic system and our Constitution do not allow – thank heavens – for anything quite so ridiculous. You either win or you lose. There’s no halfway house called sharing the spoils of victory. Using the arguments of the Labour Party, in any football match where the score is 2-1, the teams would splice the trophy between them (because we almost won).\\nI can’t understand why they’re doing this, unless it is for the express psychological purpose of helping themselves feel better and raising morale among their supporters. I’ve never been hot on manipulating the minds of the inadequately educated and the ill-informed, so I really don’t approve. Instead of telling people that Labour has a right to key positions on the grounds that it almost won, the party should explain to people that almost winning means sweet nothing, and that the party lost with a capital L and must concentrate on not losing again, rather than on bickering to slot its men into key government positions when they are not in government.\\nThe latest target of this x’gharukaza-imbasta-they-say-they’re-a-government-for-all campaign is Gordon Pisani, the government’s brand-new head of communications. Pisani was the Nationalist Party’s information secretary for almost a decade, and successfully worked through the last two general elections and EU referendum. He has a proven track record in political communications and he knows virtually everything there is to know about government policy. Oh, and another thing: he’s loyal to the government. The Labour Party speaks as though it believes that is a negative rather than a positive. Perhaps it imagines that the government’s head of communications should be somebody who didn’t vote for the government, who supports the Opposition party, and who has little or no experience of political communication? I suppose the answer to that question would be yes, given that it thought Jason Micallef to be a superb person to fill the role of secretary-general, Alfred Sant an excellent political leader, and now, Joseph Muscat a wonderful candidate for the post of prime minister. When it comes to choosing the right man (or woman) for the job, the last people anyone should consult is the Malta Labour Party, which has a long history of getting it fabulously wrong.\\nNow here we have Joseph Muscat, last seen – at least as far as I am concerned – staring at the television camera like a rabbit mesmerised by headlights on one of those discussion programmes that the leadership contenders are using to hawk their wares. He met the council members of the Federation of Industry a couple of days ago and told them something of such astounding banality that I am left in no doubt that I shan’t be deprived of yet another Labour leader for target practice. Because the Labour Party got “almost as many votes as the Nationalist Party”, he told Martin Galea and Tancred Tabone, it expects the government to treat it as an equal partner.\\nWhat? Has the man slipped and hit his head? Since when does any government treat the opposition party as an equal partner? The government is the government and the opposition is the opposition. If the opposition is an equal partner with the government, then it is no longer the opposition but part of the government. I really can’t believe that this silly chap is the great white hope of the Labour Party. We sigh with relief when he makes the occasional bit of sense, on the grounds that oh, look, here’s a Labour (potential) leader and he’s talking sense, which is roughly along the lines of oh, look, there’s a dog and it’s walking on its hind legs. But then he says something like this and we’re reminded of the very poor quality control there on the Labour production line. They sure know how to churn them out with bells on.\\nYes, the government should consult the opposition and seek consensus with it in the national interest. But at the end of the day, it’s the government that takes the decisions, and the government which shoulders the responsibility and is held accountable for the consequences of those decisions.\\nThe Labour Party and Joseph Muscat should swallow the fact that a great hash was made of things this time round (again) and that it’s paying the price for having made such a bad choice of leader and such a terrible choice of secretary-general. As my grandmother used to say, you make your bed, and you lie in it. It’s no use whining and complaining – or suggesting that the government rolls over and lets you lie on one side of the mattress.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nEvarist Bartolo – he of the vuci ta’ patri and the clothes of tal-Muzew – spoke to Labour delegates in what the pro-Labour press and di-ve.com like to call ‘the south of Malta’ or ‘is-south’ (as though Malta is so damned huge that it can be divided into north, south, east and west).\\nIn is-south – or should that be is-sawt – he promised that if those delegates were to make him party leader, then he would work to amend the electoral laws, so that “only those who have a right to vote are allowed to do so.” Are you thinking what I’m thinking? Because right now, I’m thinking that finding a Labour spokesperson who speaks sense means sending out the town-crier.\\nThe law already says that only those who have a right to vote are allowed to do so. That’s why it’s called ‘the right to vote’, because it’s in the law. If you’re voting when you don’t have the right to vote, it’s not because the law allows you to do so, but because you’re cheating the system. Evarist’s is a classic example of a nonsensical statement. What he might mean, though it is very hard to guess, is that he wants the law tightened so that fewer people have the right to vote. That would be entirely commensurate with Labour’s attitude to democracy. Or he could mean that he’s fed-up of people cheating the law and voting when they shouldn’t. But changing the law won’t help matters. Only better checks and balances will do that.\\nEvarist made another nonsensical statement (oh, what a surprise) when he said that the government has a majority of ‘half a seat’, which di-ve.com translated as ‘a half-chair’ (nofs siggu). I tried to work out what he means. We all know by now that the Nationalist Party has a one-seat majority in parliament, because the Labour Party keeps banging on about it. So where did this ‘half-chair’ come from? Oh yes – 1,500 votes are equivalent to half a chair.\\nEvarist encouraged Labour delegates to use their minds – I won’t pass a remark here – and work to have the Labour Party elected to government ‘as soon as possible’. This is part of what Alfred Sant would call the latest Labour narrative: that it is somehow possible for Labour to end up in government before 2013. I don’t know what sort of apocalyptic event they might be predicing – a fight with Dom Mintoff down at Birgu, perhaps? – but whatever it is, it’s not going to work. I know that five years might seem like ages, but believe me, they fly, especially when you’re over 35.\\nEv tal-Muzew made another latest-Labour-narrative statement when he said that the government is being arrogant – presumably by doing what it is there to do and governing – despite the fact that ‘less than half the population voted for it’. Maybe Ev can tell us of some other countries where a single party is catapulted into government with the votes of 50%+ of electors? I’ve racked my brains and haven’t come up with a single one outside those still crawling on the road to democracy, and Malta up to 2008 (bingo). Perhaps some of you might be able to help.\\nHe sounded terribly cross when he said that 4,000 people came over to vote and promptly went back again. Ev didn’t seem to like this at all, which surprises me given that at least one of his daughters, who is at university in England, was among them. It would have been a little more honest if he had told the Labour delegates ‘4,000 people, including my own daughter, came to vote and went back again’. Unlike annoying me, they have no other way of knowing because they don’t move in the tal-pepe social circles that Ev’s wife and daughters move in. And what’s wrong with coming over to vote and going back again, in any case? Ev may have failed to notice – well, he can’t have failed to notice, really, given that his daughter is taking advantage of the reduced UK university fees for citizens of EU member states – that Malta is now part of the EU and the Maltese have FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. This means that thousands of Maltese have shot off to work or study or both – Ev’s outrageously clever daughter among them (yes, she is).\\nAre we saying that they should be stripped of their right to vote, which means their right to have a direct say in who gets to run what is still their country? I don’t think so. I happen to be against the stipulation that you must, unless you have diplomatic status, spend at least six months of the year leading up to the election in Malta so as to have the right to vote. If you pay tax in Malta, you should have the right to vote even if you haven’t set foot here for 10 years. No taxation without representation, remember? There are also strong arguments for allowing certain groups of Maltese citizens to vote even when they don’t pay tax here and haven’t spent the last six months on the islands. They may still retain a direct interest in the running of the country. You don’t have to live here year-round to have a direct interest in what happens to Malta, for heaven’s sake.\\nThen Ev il-patri said that the Nationalist Party has become an unscrupulous and soulless machine (really? there are some machines which have souls and scruples?) which stops at nothing to steal votes. Get that – steal votes, not win votes. When people vote for the PN, those votes have been stolen from them, or stolen from Labour. But when people vote Labour, then that’s different.\\nLike Alfred Sant and all the other Labour dreamers, Evarist Bartolo thinks that the secret of success lies in The Media. If they can get The Media right, then they will conquer all. What do they imagine, I wonder? That the Nationalist Party has been so successful because In-Nazzjon, Il-Mument, Net and 101 are so wickedly enthralling, and not because the party has sound policies and more importantly, a sane leader? The Media…..ahjar ma nghid xejn. When a potential Labour leader thinks that a newspaper, a radio station and an internet portal are an adequate substitute for sound policy and effective leadership, you really have to give up and tear your hair.\\nFor yes, now Ev has latched on to the dream of an internet portal. He told his delegates all about it, though I would be fascinated to find out just how many of them know what a web portal is. That web portal is going to save Labour, or as Ev put it: “it will see the Labour Party enter body and soul into the world of IT” – about damned time – “enabling it to build ongoing debate with society while formulating its policies.”\\nYes. Sure it will. The day Labour formulates a policy will be the day a pink elephant strolls down Republic Street, web portal or no web portal.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLabour’s delegates have voted against widening the leadership election to take in party members. Only the naïve, or those who have scant understanding of human nature, would be surprised. This is not to say that those who tried to push the vote through are either of those things, but at this stage, I really don’t know what they were thinking.\\nWhat we have here is a situation in which a select group of people with decision-making powers, which they safeguard zealously, have been asked to vote on sharing those powers with another 19,000 people. And of course, they used that vote to deliver a resounding No. No, we don’t want to share our toys. No, because being one of the select few who can determine the future of the Labour Party and thence, of the country, gives us a sense of importance. No, because we won’t feel that important if we’re one of 20,000 rather than one of 900. No, because you insulted us by saying that you don’t trust us to make the right choice. No, no, and no again.\\nLook at it clinically, and you’ll see that asking people to vote to share their powers and privileges is bound to get a negative result. From birth, people don’t like to share. The average toddler would rather see his toy car confiscated than be forced to share it with a little friend. It goes on through the different stages of life. That’s why the biblical story of Solomon threatening to divide the baby in half is so potent. That’s what it’s all about.\\nSo 165 party delegates voted to share and 620 voted not to share. Some commentators have said that this is because they want to ensure that Joseph Muscat will become leader, and widening the electoral base to party members might bring in George Abela instead. I don’t think so. It’s a whole lot more primeval than that. The delegates are protecting their own interests and privileges. That’s all.\\nSomewhere in the course of the evening, I received a text message from a journalist friend there in the Labour arena where the big debate was going on: “I wish you were here. I feel like I’m in a theatre with a stand-up comedy act every 10 minutes.” Well, I didn’t wish I was there because my sense of humour tends to evaporate in these situations. I would have been aware every step of the way that this was how our potential prime minister was being chosen. Labour councillor Michael Cohen spoke to great applause. The party couldn’t possibly organise an election among 19,000 people in just 27 days, he said. I tend to agree with him there, given that the party couldn’t organise an election campaign or manifesto for an election for which it had had at least five years’ notice.\\nSomebody called Joe Fsadni stood up to say that delegates should vote against the motion lest they seem to be washing their hands of the responsibility for electing a decent leader, “like Pontius Pilate did with Jesus Christ.” Oh, for heaven’s sake. Lots of loud muttering later, they gave a standing ovation to the absent Alfred Sant, he who led them onwards and upwards to nothing and took 16 years to do it. But then, they were bound to applaud their own choice. The strongest argument against allowing delegates to choose a party leader is the reality of Sant, but when people are confronted with the stupidity of their own choices, they dig their heels in and become defensive.\\nThe new Labour MP Marlene Pullicino put forward the motion in favour of widening the electoral base. The tone of her speech revealed that for the best part of the last 20 years she supported the Nationalist Party, switching to Labour only after the EU membership issue was decided (she voted in favour). By then, her marriage to Nationalist MP Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando had collapsed and she had set up home with another man, which fact has provoked a cynical response of religious inconsistency to her protestations, during an interview, that she will vote against divorce because she is a Catholic. Dr Pullicino revealed that she doesn’t really understand the mindset of a party she joined as a fairly recent convert. She still thinks like a Nationalist.\\n“When were Laburisti ever scared of change?” she asked her audience. Well, I’m sorry, but that would be for most of the last 30 years or so. The Labour Party has morphed into the most conservative political grouping in the country, beating the Nationalist Party which now remains conservative only in terms of conformity to the dominant religion, which is bad enough.\\n“The aim is to have a strong leader who will take us to victory and push the Nationalists out of government,” Dr Pullicino said. Ah, but here’s the thing. Her idea of a strong leader is the Nationalist idea of a strong leader, which is why she thinks that George Abela is the obvious choice by far, as I and thousands of others who are not Laburisti do. Dr Pullicino is thinking like a Nationalist – in other words, she is making an intelligent and pragmatic decision as to who is most likely to pull in the floaters and the doubters – and not like a Laburista iffissata, who doesn’t understand how The Others think. Marlene Pullicino knows exactly how The Others think, because she was one of them for a long time. “Use your minds and not your hearts,” she enjoined her audience – uselessly, as it turns out, because it all depends on what kind of minds we’re talking about here.\\nThe resounding defeat of that motion, which is now linked in the public and party mind with George Abela – indeed, Dr Pullicino is one of his champions – tells us that Abela, like the motion, will be resoundingly defeated too. You can argue that he put himself to the vote before actually putting himself to the vote. What we had here was a test-run. The delegates were put out by his motion and they are put out by him.\\nAbela took a big risk with this one, but it doesn’t seem to have been a calculated risk. He didn’t stand any chance of pushing his motion through because people don’t vote to limit their powers and privileges, but to increase them or to stop them being shared or restricted. By pushing for this motion, he alienated the delegates by more or less saying that he doesn’t have confidence in their judgement. This means that they’re not exactly going to trip over themselves to vote for him now, no matter how hard he campaigns. So insisting on widening the electoral base to members never had the slightest chance of getting him that wider electorate he needed, and at the same time, it lost him the only electorate he was ever going to have.\\nJoseph Muscat can smirk all the way to 5 June, and the rest of us had better become accustomed to the sight of that self-satisfied face because we’re going to be seeing lots more of Alfred Sant Mark II, with the same mannerisms, the same verbal tics, and the same shirt-cuffs hanging halfway down the hand because the arms are too short or the sleeves are too long, and there appear to be no bespoke shirt-makers in Brussels. No. The Labour Party doesn’t like change.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLast Friday’s performance at the Labour Party points to a fundamental schism that has now become a chasm. This is what divides the typical, old-style Laburisti, who make up the majority of party delegates and supporters, from the truly new Labour element that is far, far removed from the fictitiously ‘new’ Labour of Alfred Sant.\\nGeorge Abela is not just another leadership contender, but the representative of a particular strain of thinking within the Labour Party. This is the pro-active, positive-thinking, can-do, chip-free element that is light years away from the negative, resentful, fearful, anti-change, no-clue-how-things-should-be-done, they-owe-me-a-living attitude of almost everyone else within that party.\\nI can usually guess which way somebody votes by his or her attitude to life in general. Sometimes I’m wrong, but only sometimes – because on the whole, people who are energetic and who have initiative, who are pro-active and outward-looking, who enjoy challenges and who understand that no one owes them a living, who strive to improve their lot through their own hard work, determination and efforts, who are enthusiastic for more and better work, tend to vote Nationalist. Those who are brimful of resentment, who think that they are owed something by somebody somewhere, who are negative, defeatist, fearful of change, envious of others yet who won’t go out of their way to improve their own lives, tend to vote Labour.\\nThis is a generalisation, but it is far from a gross generalisation. It is actually a very safe one. Of course, there are exceptions, as with everything else, especially when you consider that so many people here vote out of habit or in line with family tradition. But on the whole, I usually find that proactive people with initiative are attracted to the Nationalist Party while negative and defeatist people with personal resentments and chips on their shoulder are attracted to the Labour Party.\\nThis is the reason why young people from Labour families start voting Nationalist when they go into tertiary education or begin to develop successful lives and careers. Labour politicians have gone on record as saying that they think this is because these young people are ashamed of being associated with Labour as they see it as the partit tal-hamalli. Oh, how wrong they are. It’s not that at all, but goes much deeper. A person who comes from a Labour working-class background but who strives for wider horizons, a broader outlook, and a more interesting life with a good career has the aspirations and the attitude that align him or her to the Nationalist Party, and not to Labour. People from working-class Labour backgrounds who want to get ahead in life vote Nationalist not because of shame but because of politics, policies and beliefs.\\nLabour has become a party for losers, and I don’t mean that in the electoral sense. The Nationalists, on the other hand, have somehow managed to become a party for can-doers and winners. The unspoken (and sometimes spoken) exhortation that underpins virtually every message coming out of the Nationalist Party and the governments it has formed over the last 21 years is essentially this: ‘You can do it. Stride right in and conquer.’ Labour’s message over the equivalent period? ‘You can’t do it. It’s impossible. You will never survive.’ This is the main reason why the two parties have come to attract completely different kinds of people, and why the George Abela faction is in such an unwanted minority within the Labour Party.\\nFriday’s meeting was a metaphor for all of this. The George Abela faction is made up entirely – at least, as far as I can observe – of go-getting people with initiative who have made something of their lives and who are acutely sensitive to the new direction that Labour must take if it is to equip itself for the 21st century. At the Friday meeting, this faction was clearly distinct from the rest in terms of content and delivery of speeches, manner of dress and general attitude. It is the faction that represents the only viable future for Labour, but sadly, it seems to have been consigned to the past already.\\nSo isn’t Joseph Muscat one of those go-getting people with initiative, then? Well, yes – and no. A mysterious ingredient is missing. While it is undeniable that he is rabidly ambitious and all out to get to the top, there is something there, or perhaps something not there, which slots him into a different category entirely to the ‘can-do’ people I’m talking about. I get a weird sense that the man is going through the motions as though he’s acting a part in a play, without really grasping what it’s all about – like somebody who is sitting for an examination having learned all the texts by rote but without truly getting a handle on them, so all he can do is repeat what was learned by heart rather than interpreting what was learned. I would definitely slot him into the Old Labour category along with Alfred Sant, because Old Labour wasn’t just about violence and corruption but also about one’s attitude to life.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nBiography excerpted from Who is Angelo Farrugia? – ‘violet revolution in Giorgia’ and all. He must have had pink elephants on his mind at the time.\\nAnglu Farrugia has come up with a cunning plan to bring down the illegitimate government. He wants passive resistance and mass meetings every fortnight. After all, if Eddie Fenech Adami did it in the years 1981 to 1987, why can’t Joseph Muscat do the same in 2008 to 2013? That was a rhetorical question. We’re not all as interestingly-brained as Anglu Farrugia, who expounded these views in an interview on Super One radio earlier today.\\nFarrugia used the opportunity to tell his audience of plebeians that he is an expert in international law, who graduated magna cum laude from the University of Malta. Imagine being in your 50s and boasting about these things. Is it a disease that affects Labour’s big cheeses exclusively? Farrugia took the trouble of explaining, for the benefit of those plebs, what magna cum laude means.\\nWell, here’s another one who’s divorced from reality. Does he honestly think that what people really, really want is another run of boycotts, partisan hatred, Sunday outings to mass meetings, the preaching of fear and hatred, attempts at bringing down the government, and lots of other jolly ideas that destabilise the economy? All this when a factory that employs 2,200 is threatening to shut down its operation here?\\nThese people are nuts.\\n  \\n\\n\\nBook by Anglu Farrugia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, May 13th, 2008 at 8:06 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn one of the comments sections, somebody posted this quotation from an infamous speech by Dom Mintoff in December 1979, just two months after Malta endured its worst rain-storm ever, in which two people drowned. I’m re-posting it here because it perfectly encapsulates the Labour government’s approach to the ‘modernisation’ of Malta’s infrastructure.\\n“Ghandna progett iehor ukoll, li fih ahna rridu naghmlu li nistghu biex nghinu lil kullhadd halli nibnu tankijiet tal-gebel u mhux tal-hadid u anqas tal-konkos, biex nifrankaw il-flus li jmorru barra minn Malta.

The man just won’t go away. Alfred Sant is like one of those annoying trick candles that go on children’s birthday cakes: you think you’ve blown them out but they flare up again. Let me guess, now – most of you thought that he had retired gracefully from the limelight when he gave what you thought – mistakenly, alas – was his swansong press conference a couple of days after the election, when he was finally able to unglue his lips and admit that he had been trounced once more.\\nAfter all, he said that he had resigned irrevocably, didn’t he? And there I was, cynical little so-and-so that I am, convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that when parliament convened, he would pop back into our lives like one of those creatures that never dies. And sure enough, just when you thought that it was safe to get back in the water…\\nYou have to admit that it’s almost funny. If you don’t look at the farcical side of all this, you’ll be forced to confront the fact that things have gone a little bit bananas, and that can get you down. It is beyond weird to see the same man addressing parliament, as leader of the opposition, after his fourth consecutive hammering at the polls. And then he has the brass neck to insist on the resignations of others who are in a far, far less embarrassing position than he is. Astonishingly, he isn’t embarrassed at all. Anybody else would have crept in covered in shame, or frankly, just stayed home and fed the chickens. But Sant just stood there and spoke as though the past 16 years haven’t happened.\\nHis speech in parliament was a disturbing taste of what the Labour Party is going to be like for the next five years: Sant behaving as though it is still 1992, with his clone Joseph Muscat trying and failing to build a strong identity for himself in the dark shadow of the man who made him. Between now and 2013, the Labour Party is going to have two leaders, Alfred Sant and Joseph Muscat, and make no mistake about it: it’s Muscat, the official leader, who will be cast in the role of bridesmaid.\\nThe few people who pounced on me for continuing to write about Alfred Sant in the aftermath of the election, on the grounds that he had ‘irrevocably resigned’ and should be left to rest in peace, must be wondering what’s going on. They must have looked at the photographs of him speaking in parliament as though he had never resigned at all, and said to themselves: “You’re kidding me, right?” Ah, but no – there’s no kidding involved. I really hate saying ‘I told you so’ because you got pummelled for that kind of thing in the playground, but here goes: I told you so.\\n\\nNow that I am safe in the knowledge that there is no risk of his ever being prime minister again, unless he is going to be the wild card in the leadership election (nothing surprises me at this stage), I can dissect him for fun rather than out of necessity. The next few weeks should be most amusing.\\nLet’s begin with his shock-horror-x’gharukaza announcement that the government, using its power of incumbency of course, waived (not pardoned, for heaven’s sake, as reported in the newspapers) €2.6 million in income tax owed by 1,061 individuals. You may have failed to notice, as I who keep track of these things did, that this was the first time ever since Malta joined the Eurozone that Sant referred to a sum of money in euros rather than liri. Throughout the election campaign, whenever he mentioned money, it was in liri, as though admitting the fact of our new currency was something that stuck in his throat because he hadn’t agreed with it. All the proposals in his error-ridden electoral manifesto were calculated in round sums of liri, rather than round sums of euros.\\nSo why did he suddenly decide to give the total sum of tax waived in euros rather than his pet liri as usual? Ah, my dear Watson – that’s because it multiplies the figure to something that sounds a lot more impressive. He reckoned without that irritating Daphne and her pesky calculator, who immediately sat down and did what the newspaper reporters should have done before getting too impressed. I worked out what that comes to as an average per head, and it’s a considerably less impressive €2450, or in Sant’s preferred currency, Lm1,052.\\nNow please tell me what is so damned shocking or extraordinary about waiving €2450 in contested taxes that have been due over several years, particularly if this was done to collect a much fuller sum. But Sant is using his old tricks once more – firing off claims and figures, secure in the knowledge that few people are going to look beneath the blast and bombast and actually analyse his claims. I’m sorry, but I’m not exactly going to keel over in shock if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue waives €2450 which Johnny down the road insists he doesn’t owe the taxman. As anybody knows, who runs a business and who has a brain somewhere there between his ears, it’s better to collect €20,000 immediately and to write off €2450 as a bad debt than to pursue €22,450 through the courts for 20 years, after which you might still very well end up with nothing.\\nSant himself admitted as much when he said that the individual sums waived varied between €1000 (a paltry Lm420) and €10,000 (Lm4,292). If that was the highest figure waived, we’re not exactly talking about big cats, bigger cheeses and the barunijiet that appear to have been erased from Sant’s vocabulary. He acknowledged, too, that these sums were due over several years, so we’re not talking here about the Commissioner of Inland Revenue being ordered by the power-of-incumbency government to waive the current taxes of 1,061 party apparatchiks.\\nExhaustingly, the man is still banging on about honesty and integrity, and this when he is prancing about in parliament, as leader of the opposition, after the general public booed him off the political stage four times in a row. Oh, but all of that wasn’t his fault, because as he has so carefully explained to us, he lost this election only because the government used its power of incumbency to buy votes. And what was his excuse the last time, and the time before that, and the time before that again? Clearly, he hadn’t yet turned up the phrase ‘power of incumbency’ while ploughing through his journals.\\nRead my lips, Alfred Sant: the Nationalist Party won the election because you were the leader of the Labour Party. Face that fact and let the country get on with the business of living. Go away, please, and leave us alone. What more will it take to drive home the message to you that you’re not wanted? Isn’t there some power of incumbency you might want to be getting on with up at Mile End?\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThanks to the assiduous research of one reader of this blog, here’s another storja tal-wahx. It’s particularly dear to me because it encapsulates the prospects of my generation of school-leavers. I was 16 when Mintoff gave this speech in 1981, outlining his plans to set up another organised gang of workers, this time called Id-Dejma, to provide work for the thousands of people aged between 18 and 25 who had no jobs. It reminds me why one of my best friends, privately educated, cried with relief when she found a job that paid Lm80 a month, standing behind a shop counter for nine hours a day dealing with rude customers. Or why one of my other best friends, also privately educated, rose at 5am to take two buses to a radiator factory where she began work at 7am, answering phones for Lm30 a week. And we were the lucky ones, who got our amazingly lucrative jobs laden with thrilling prospects through a network of parental contacts. Everybody else had to join Mintoff’s Dejma or live off their parents.\\n“Biex ma nhallux lil dan il-fjur ta’ pajjiz jintilef se nergghu nifthu korp iehor, differenti min ta’ qabel. Se jidhlu fih dawk ta’ bejn it-18 u l-25 sena. Ghal erbatax il-xahar biss, biex wara jsibu fl-industrija u jidhlu ohrajn flokhom. Din il-forza se jkun jisimha ‘id-dejma’, ghax irridu nfakru fl-antik. Fl-antik il-Maltin kienu ffurmaw id-dejma li kienu johorgu bil-lejl biex iharsu u jiddefendu lil-pajjizna. Kull sena se nibdew indahhlu forza biex nidefendu lil Malta.”\\n – Dom Mintoff addresses a meeting in Birkirkara, 31 May 1981\\nWhat vision! And then they say that this man was is-Salvatur ta’ Malta. No wonder they ended up with Alfred Sant, and foisted him on the rest of us.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nAnother year, another Eurovision Song Contest – is it my imagination, or is the fever a little less, well, feverish this time? Maybe our serial losses have dampened our enthusiasm, or perhaps we’ve grown up and stopped being so Swedish about it all.\\nBjorn Erichsen, who is not Swedish but Danish and the director of Eurovision television, has accused the BBC and the great British public of failing to consider the annual cheese-fest with the gravitas it deserves. “They take it much more seriously in Sweden,” he said accusingly last week. “They have a genuine love and respect for it there.” Erichsen singled out Terry Wogan as being symptomatic of the naughty British attitude towards the song contest. “Terry Wogan is a problem because he makes it look ridiculous,” he said. “I know he is very popular and maybe that is the reason why a lot of people watch. But one day he will have to retire and the BBC will have to find someone else. It will be interesting to see if that attitude changes.”\\nNo, it won’t – because Wogan doesn’t shape the British attitude towards the Eurovision Song Contest. He reflects it. His successor will be the same, because the British audience is never going to accept a commentator who treats the show with reverence, or who doesn’t pillory it. To the British, and to increasingly many Maltese of whom I am one, the Eurovision Song Contest is a camp, over-the-top event that we love to hate. Over the years, it has become a parody of itself. The winning acts are the ones that realize this, like Lordi, and not the ones that take themselves too seriously, like anyone from Malta.\\nThe Eurovision Song Contest only regained popularity in Britain when Wogan began his caustic commentary. Thanks to him, the show now pulls in around 10 million viewers in Britain alone, and countless other millions who watch the BBC broadcast over cable or satellite. In Malta, those with the Swedish approach to Eurovision watch the TVM broadcast, while the rest stick with Terry Wogan and the BBC. Sometimes, we non-Swedes switch to TVM for the sheer pleasure of hearing all that breathless football-type commentary that is as devoid of humour as a computer instruction manual. The reverse happens, too, and the Swedish types of Europe zap to Wogan to give themselves a frisson of irritation and even outrage. The Danes went nuts seven years ago when he described the Danish presenters as ‘Doctor Death and the tooth fairy’, which pretty much summed them up.\\nThe controversy made it to the leading article of The Sunday Telegraph last week:\\nWith so many of humanity’s harmless pastimes now delivered to us wrapped in swirling mists of bombast – when football and rugby and even snooker, for heaven’s sake, must be shown, not simply as enjoyable games, but as the elemental conflicts of demigods – Sir Terry Wogan’s obstinately unserious approach to the Eurovision Song Contest goes refreshingly against the grain. Congratulations, to quote Sir Cliff Richard, are certainly due to the BBC for allowing him to go on, year after year, gently ribbing this fiesta of musical inconsequence….The contest is a precious opportunity for the peoples of Europe to come together in a spirit of mutual ridicule, to exchange incomprehensible rude remarks, and bombard each other with harmless volleys of La La La and Boom Bang-a-Bang. It would be appalling if it were to be destroyed by a spirit of earnestness or reverence.\\nAmen to that. If only some of the more earnest people here, including the Maltasong Board or whatever it’s called, would take that advice on board.\\n\\nNow bear with me while I put on my language police cap. We have a new parliament – it would be stretching things to call it fresh – and this has brought with it the usual set-my-teeth-on-edge references to the legislature as a period of time (five years) rather than an actual physical body of people who legislate. I’m not going to delve into the matter of how, in Maltese, ‘legislatura’ (surely that should be ‘legizlatura’?) came to mean the five years between the state opening of parliament and its dissolution. That’s what it has come to mean, and I am not about to argue with the rapidly-evolving mysteries of the language. The important thing is to remember that ‘legislatura’ and ‘legislature’ no longer mean the same thing, even if there was once a better-informed time when they did. This means that ‘tul din il-legislatura’ does not translate as ‘during this legislature’, because the legislature is made up of people, and not of days, months or years. Now that’s off my chest (take it easy, Jason).\\n\\nAlfred Sant, whose constitutional role as leader of the opposition, when he is not leader of the opposition party, is being questioned, stood up in parliament to refresh our memory of why we stampeded to vote him away from the prime minister’s chair three times on the trot.\\nSomebody really needs to put this man out of his misery, because evidently the will of the electorate is not enough to give him the message. He is clearly somebody who insists on seeing the glass as half-full, at least where his own personal interests are concerned. Instead of telling himself that Malta decided three times in a row that it didn’t want him as prime minister, he tells himself that almost as many people voted for him as for Lawrence Gonzi. This is like trying to jump across a deep chasm, missing the other side by half an inch, and then telling yourself, when you’re lying at the bottom with your back broken in three places, that you almost made it. Ah, but you didn’t make it.\\nI really don’t know how people took his speech seriously, especially now that there is no risk of him becoming prime minister ever again, unless he plans to challenge the party-leader contenders unexpectedly, as he did last time. The man is a walking, talking joke, and he should be treated as such. Consider his latest narrative, which is the name he likes to give to his interpretations of reality. A clique of mysterious but powerful people have turned the Nationalist Party into a brand and a tool, and are using this branded tool to control all the major decisions taken in Malta. Sant is afraid that this network is attempting to manipulate the Labour Party, but he knows that the Labour Party is strong enough to resist.\\nHeaven knows that there are enough conspiracy theorists and sci-fi enthusiasts on the internet, using names like Trojan Warrior and Purple Warlord, debating with each other the various ins and outs of political life in Malta. It comes as no surprise to see evidence once more that the won’t-go-away leader of the opposition is one of them. That Alfred Sant lives in a world of his own making has been obvious for some time. Now, because he sees that some people who sympathise with the Nationalist Party find it easy to relate to some other people who sympathise with that faction of the Labour Party which supports George Abela, he sees this as an attempt by the former to infiltrate and colonise the Labour Party, by using the George Abela faction as a Trojan horse.\\nSant didn’t spell it out, but as an expert reader of his mental meanderings (and I should be one by now), I can tell you that this is exactly what he is thinking. It doesn’t occur to him, because he is not one who suffers from self-doubt, that what this says is one thing only: that he and his immediate predecessors have been the main cause of Malta’s internecine political warfare, by behaving like dangerous and threatening enemies instead of like fellow Maltese with different opinions. Alfred Sant, Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici all had (and still have) a serious attitude problem. They are very different people but they have one thing in common: their political behaviour was and is sociopathic. Even those who don’t even know the meaning of the word somehow sense this. It manifested itself in a desire to push their ideas through at all costs, regardless of the damage caused to the people and the country.\\nEven now, with his ideas rejected at the polls for the third time – the fourth time, if you factor in the referendum on Europe – Sant used his first speech in parliament to defend and justify his plan to cut the electricity surcharge by half and to tell us how wrong we were not to choose him over Gonzi. The most astonishing thing is that he wasn’t barracked from the benches on the other side – and there is strong justification for barracking, too, from the benches on his side, given the irreparable long-term damage he has caused his party.\\nAlfred Sant, like an unwanted guest, shows no signs of leaving even when every member of the household is yawning, looking at their watch, or making increasingly longer trips to the bathroom, then loudly announcing that they are retiring to bed because they have an early start tomorrow. We go to bed, wake up the next morning, and find him still on our sofa, ready to engage us in another irritating conversation. And there is nothing we can do to turf him out, because when we get back from work 10 hours later, he’s still there, taking a bath and cooking himself some supper.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nEvarist Bartolo is cross because Malta Today somehow got hold of the particulars of Labour Party delegates. This allowed the newspaper to ring them and canvass their opinion on who should be the new leader. Ev is cross, he says, because the delegates are now exposed to vindictiveness, and besides, their opinion has been conditioned by the result of that survey.\\nI think it’s not concern for the welfare of delegates that has made Ev so upset, but the fact that in this survey, he trailed in last. His survey position was pretty much that of the tin-cans hauled behind a car with the words Just Married sprayed on the windscreen. And there are no prizes for guessing who streamed in first and who was a far second.\\nEv has only himself to blame. One minute he’s passing himself off as Suor Bartolo on some television discussion programme. The next minute he’s parading about the streets dressed like tal-Muzew. And every time he opens his mouth to pass a remark or reply to a question, I expect his sentences to be punctuated with a Hisssssssss like Kaa the talking snake in Disney’s The Jungle Book.\\nHis latest pearls of wisdom are that if Labour brains work together carefully (chance would be a fine thing), they can truncate the life of this government – Hissssss! – which has stolen – Hissssss! – the election with a campaign based on lies and favours, and which continues to govern incompetently and arrogantly. Hissssss!\\nStolen the election, Ev? I understand that you teach at the university, and one of the first things you’re supposed to teach your students is the importance of looking at things objectively. You’re damned lucky that not one of your students has the nerve to ask you to explain – Hisssssss! – how, in your view, the Nationalist Party stole this election. But you never know, one of them might, so you had better begin marshalling your evidence in case you end up looking an even bigger fool than you do now.\\nMaybe Ev thinks of it as stolen ghax kien it-tern ta’ Elfrid, jahasra miskin, wara li tilef tnejn wara xulxin u hatfulu r-referendu. Or maybe Ev thinks it was stolen because the Nationalist Party is characterised by the way in which it inspires blind faith and obsession in its legions of poorly educated supporters, who believe everything they are told and can’t think for themselves – unlike Labour Party delegates.\\nArrogant and incompetent? If those words bring anything at all to mind, it’s the man who stood up in parliament last week and reminded us why we stampeded to rid ourselves of him in 1998. And – yawn! – he’s still here, trying to convince us, like a L’Oreal advertisement, that he’s worth it.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nElfrid and Jason, with the help of a couple of amateur campaigners who shall go unmentioned but who have featured elsewhere on this blog, and who are best described using coarse euphemisms for the male reproductive organ, tried to ‘steal’ the election by using a couple of cheap tricks. Now one of those cheap tricks has come back to haunt them.\\nIt’s that billboard emblazoned with the faces of government ministers and the word CORRUPTION, for all the world as though Elfrid had in mind the government of Karmenu’s day, when he was prezident tal-partit and accepting invitations to holidays on Soviet dachas. But let’s not go there. He has resigned irrevocably, after all, and happened to be speaking in parliament the other day only because he was sick of speaking to the chickens in his backyard.\\nDeputy leader Michael Falzon has said on television that he insisted with the party bosses ‘at the highest level’ (and given that he is deputy leader, the only person at a level higher than his was Elfrid) that plans for that billboard must be scrapped. He was ignored. There were other billboards that upset him, but this was the worst one, he said.\\n“Quite apart from the fact that it was in bad taste, it was also libellous, and I said so immediately,” he told his interviewer. “I was told, insultingly, that I had a conflict of interest and that they would seek the opinion of another lawyer with greater expertise in libel law. I don’t know if they actually did that. All I know is that the billboard went up and we were hit with 16 libel suits.”\\nA conflict of interest – will they get a grip? The lawyer who the Labour Party uses for its libel suits (for and against) is Pawlu Lia. I should know, given that I have had to stand across from his sourpuss I’ve-just-sucked-a-lemon face for countless times in a courtroom while he picks at nits (metaphorically, of course) and struggles to overcome the urge to spit at me. Ghastly man – now there’s someone who seems to lose his objectivity at the sound of my name or the magic words ‘Labour Party’. Maybe they didn’t consult him about the billboard. Maybe they did. Who cares? All we know is that Dr Sourpuss now has his work cut out for him. No wonder the last time I rushed to court for a hearing I was told that I had rushed in vain, because “Dr Lia is indisposed.”\\nThis little vignette adds to all that we suspected already from that performance in the counting-hall and the fact that Michael Falzon was left, like the fall guy, to sit there and then to concede defeat, which was Alfred Sant’s job. I’m going to take a little diversion here and put it in upper case. IT WAS ALFRED SANT’S DUTY TO CONCEDE DEFEAT AS PARTY LEADER, BUT HE COULDN’T DO IT BECAUSE HE IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNABLE TO ADMIT DEFEAT EVEN TO HIMSELF, STILL LESS TO THE WHOLE OF MALTA. HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW HE HAS BEEN THROUGH THREE GENERAL ELECTION LOSSES AND ONE REFERENDUM HAMMERING WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY ADMITTING DEFEAT? OR AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS NOTICED THAT HE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THE MAGIC WORDS ‘LOSS’, ‘LOST’ OR ‘DEFEAT’, NOT EVEN DURING HIS IRREVOCABLE RESIGNATION SPEECH? There. Think about it, and what it tells us about this ‘man’.\\nSo this little vignette that Michael painted for us is very telling. What we can see is The Others ganging up on him and excluding him, mocking him for having a sensible opinion and telling them that they were using a high-risk strategy. And the dynamics of this particular group were there again in evidence in the counting-hall. Michael didn’t realise he was in among the freaks. He couldn’t communicate with them because he’s normal and they’re not. In a situation like that, the only way is to pack your bags, raise a reverse salute and leave, because you can’t win and trying to do so just ends up eroding your sanity.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nThe public persona of Joseph Muscat in this leadership campaign is a perfect echo of the public persona of Alfred Sant in the run-up to the 1996 election. It is this, and not just the fact that he is the anointed one, that makes him the Labour favourite. The flipside is that it is also precisely this that renders him so repugnant to floaters and to those who support the Nationalist Party. Labour, as we have had numerous other occasions to see, knows little about public affairs and political marketing, and is returning to the political market-place with a clone of its failed product.\\nBut we know that already. The interesting thing is that you can read the Labour yes-men’s line of thought: if Sant scaled the summit in 1996, then Sant’s clone will do the same in 2013. Ho hum. That’s not very clever. Sant’s image worked in 1996 because the conditions were right, he promised to remove value added tax, and he was widely perceived to be a fresh phenomenon in the Labour Party, though he was anything but. Oh, and he was propped up on one side by George Abela, who was widely admired by the people we like to call floaters, but who are really nothing more than individuals who like to hedge their bets. Some people I know have taken to calling themselves floaters, as though it conveys a sense of political independence rather than political immaturity and wishy-washiness. But anyway – all things are not similarly equal today and we have been through the Sant experience for rather too long and disliked it immensely. A Sant clone who pushes all the wrong memory buttons is going to be frowned upon now and not welcomed. That’s why Labour loves Joseph Muscat but almost everyone who didn’t vote Labour this time round or the time before that thinks he’s repellent.\\nGeorge Abela had something sensible to say about this kind of thinking in a newspaper article a few days ago: “The party’s greatest foe is the unspoken reasoning that, having lost three elections, the next one must surely be owed to us; it’s the convoluted logic that the more we lose then the more we are sure to win. It is the logic of staying put which was followed in 2003 and which has kept us out (of government) to the present day. It is pointless to preach to the converted, yet the converted would do well to consider what it takes to win new converts. When all is said and done, what matters is the party’s ability to attract new support. For this, the keyword is credibility, especially since elections in Malta have become presidential, for better or worse.”\\nHe’s right, of course. But sensible people don’t stand a chance of getting to the top in the Labour Party, which is increasingly beginning to put me in mind of some madly Orwellian novel written by Ben Elton (I’ve just read Blind Faith and loved it). For the past four decades, Labour has been about little other than creating an alternative reality to be inhabited by the chosen few, while the rest of us are obliged to go along with The Project. Now we can expect more of the same.\\n\\nSuper One has carried on where it left off. There are lots of people with doctorates on the Labour benches, but until now, the only one whose doctorate has been made an integral part of his name is DoctorAlfredSant (one word). Everyone else is referred to as John Borg and Borg in the rest of the report, but DoctorAlfredSant has his five-syllable moniker repeated throughout the story. During Super One bulletins in the electoral campaign, I sometimes found myself resisting the urge to do the funky-chicken round the television set, squawking ‘DoctorElfridSantDoctorElfridSantDoctorElfridSant.’\\nAnd oh joy – now we have DoctorJosephMuscat (one word, and a whole syllable more than DoctorAlfredSant). The other four are Falzon, Bartolo, Coleiro Preca and Abela, but he is DoctorJosephMuscat, six times in the same news report. And so the cloning goes on. We are even being treated to the same obsessive focus on his ‘managerial style’ and ‘managerial qualifications’ – as though the first task of a prime minister is to be managerial, rather than inspirational.\\n\\nIs it my imagination, or are we all tired already of Joseph Muscat, when we should be excited by him? Imagine, then, how we’re going to feel about him five years from now, when he has exhausted the little bit of novelty value that he had. OK, so they might send him to media training and turn him into something personable, but I don’t know. If I see once more that ‘I starred in Brokeback Mountain’ photograph which he insists on handing out to the media, my mind will blank him out altogether.\\nSome days ago, he made public his proposals for a better Malta: I have a dream, yadayadayadayada. Martin Luther King’s famous words are devalued by six notches further. DoctorJosephMuscat (one word, remember) has a dream that he will make Malta ‘the best in Europe.’ Oh for God’s sake, man – grow up. The best in Europe at what? And why do we have to be the best when mere normality is what we all crave and are repeatedly denied? What now, the Denmark of the Mediterranean? The Sweden of the Middle Sea?\\nThese people are so damned exhausting with their high-flown talk and their projects for castles in the air. All we want is to have our roads fixed and our towns cleaned up, jobs and earnings and a quiet life, and they insist on ramming their pseudo-Utopian dreams down our throats like cod-liver oil.\\nDoctorJosephMuscat’s I-have-a-dream sounded even odder when I read the details because it appeared as though he hasn’t been in Malta much and doesn’t know what’s going on, and that he hasn’t read the Nationalist Party’s electoral programme. He wants job creation and full employment to be made a priority (we’re near full employment already, and there are more jobs than people in several new sectors). He wants public health services to be the best and free of charge (wake up, sir). And he wants everyone to have access to information technology, with access to the internet considered ‘a basic right’ (never one to miss out on a bit of melodrama, this chap – basic right, indeed).\\nIf DoctorJosephMuscat really means what he says then he belongs in the Nationalist Party. If he meant this all along, and didn’t just dream it up now (“I have a dream….”) then we must ask what he was doing in the sod-awful Labour Party when the only way of achieving his ‘dream’ for Malta was through the Nationalist Party.\\nWhile he was barracking Eddie Fenech Adami at pre-electoral press conferences like Charlon Gouder with Lawrence Gonzi this time around, while he was writing articles telling us that DoctorAlfredSant (one word, remember) was right and that EU membership would be disastrous for Malta, while he was behaving like the puppy on the His Master’s Voice record label, all the action was going on elsewhere – in the Nationalist Party.\\nI am beginning to suspect that the main reason Muscat – he wasn’t DoctorJosephMuscat in those days – joined the Labour Party rather than the Nationalist Party is because he perceived correctly that, with such an immense dearth of competition, he would be able to ingratiate himself with The Leadership and worm his way to the top. The only thing we can credit him with at this stage is the fact that he quite obviously had the foresight to see that it was only a matter of time before he became party leader.\\nAs I have had occasion to repeat in the past, the Labour Party is notoriously devoid of quality control systems and we are about to see once more the deep danger that poses.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n\\nJoseph Muscat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, May 21st, 2008 at 3:54 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nWho cares why we lost as long as I win?\\nThe Labour Party’s ‘national executive’ – for such a disorganized bunch they’ve got a pretty complicated hierarchy – has decided to publish the ‘why we lost’ report. And please don’t all yell out in chorus ‘Oh, so they lost, then, did they? I thought the Nationalists stole it from them.’\\nUntil Monday, which is the big day of its release, we can amuse ourselves by guessing at its contents. I wonder whether Godfrey Grima wrote it. He wrote the last one and he’s been doing a lot of hanging about with Jason and DoctorJosephMuscat (one word) recently. So let’s hazard some guesses at what’s in that report then.\\n1.The Nationalists had the power of incumbency. 2. The Nationalists had the power of incumbency. 3. The Nationalists had the power of incumbency. 4. They stole our votes. 5. A crack team at Air Malta gave cheap flights to people who wanted to fly in to vote PN and obstructed those who wanted to fly in to vote Labour. 6. The Malta Planning and Environment Authority issued hundreds of permits in the last week of the campaign. 7. The Inland Revenue waived tax arrears. 8. They’ve been viciously targeting DoctorElfridSant (one word) for years. 9. They’ve infiltrated the media. 10. They control all the systems of power. 11. They used their power of incumbency to promise favours.12. They bought votes from Labour drug-addicts for 70 euros (thank you for your investigations, Inspector Farrugia).\\nA little bird tells me that this report doesn’t contain a single sentence that even remotely resembles this one: we lost because the thrice-rejected Alfred Sant was still leader of the party and people didn’t want him as prime minister. The little bird might be wrong, but I doubt it. We’ll wait until Monday.\\nSo members of the ‘national executive’ will get their copies of the ‘why we lost’ report on Monday night, and they have until Saturday to read it through – mouthing the words and moving their fingers along the page, probably, if it takes all that time to do it. On Saturday morning, they will discuss it at a meeting. If the meeting isn’t wrapped up that same morning, possibly because one half of the national executive has fallen out with the other half on the question of how many people were cheaply flown in to vote by Air Malta, the national executive will adjourn until the following Monday. At that point, the 80-page report will be uploaded onto the Labour Party website – the other one, not Maltastar.com – and the party delegates will be given the printed version. With luck, a good number of them will know how to read it, because they are expected to use it to form their decision on whom to vote for in the leadership election.\\nThat should be interesting. ‘We lost because of DoctorElfridSant so let’s choose DoctorElfridSant Mk II.’\\nSome members of the national executive said that the ‘why we lost’ report shouldn’t be published because, they claimed, ‘the party’s agenda is being dictated by barranin.’ That doesn’t mean foreigners. It means outsiders. A couple of pragmatists said that once it would probably end up being leaked to the press anyway, they might as well limit the damage by publishing it themselves and preempting a leak.\\nIn 2003, Labour had the same kind of ‘why we lost’ report. Godfrey Grima wrote it (and gosh, it must have been really perceptive, because look at them now). Members of the national executive were not entrusted with a copy of their own, one assumes because of the danger of leakage. I don’t know what they were so worried about. Like I said, Godfrey Grima wrote it, so I don’t imagine it contained any damning statements about how Alfred Sant made an utter hash of things and scared thousands of people away. Grima admires DoctorElfridSant and thinks that he is statesmanlike and that people were horribly mean to him. So back then, the national executive members who wanted to get a good look at the report had to read it on the premises at Labour HQ, possibly in a locked room with an armed guard after having been frisked for cameras and mobile phones with a photographic facility.\\nSo remember that you heard it here first. Alfred Sant had nothing to do with the fact that Labour lost – sorry – had this election stolen from them. The fault lies at the door of the power of incumbency and Air Malta’s crack team of flight organisers. After all, this is the world capital of failure to assume responsibility for one’s actions.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nHarry Vassallo’s sell-by date has long since come and gone, like DoctorElfridSant’s. But like DoctorElfridSant, he doesn’t know the meaning of the words ‘it’s over’. He stills heads Alternattiva Demokratika, he still writes newspaper columns that rant against MLPN, and he still can’t see any difference between the two big parties. As far as he’s concerned, they’re both his enemies and so he can lump them into the same basket.\\nThis is Harry, writing in The Times today:\\nThe MLPN is one entity, one fundamental political philosophy, a game played by the same rules producing the same result: progress at the slowest pace possible. It is a vast tacit alliance digesting the indigestible contradictions it contains. It is sustainable development preached by those who have determined the unsustainability of the country for long decades to come, by those who have lived off the proceeds of unsustainable development all their lives. They honestly think that they can pull it off.\\nOver the years, I came to notice increasing similarities between the personality and public persona of DoctorElfridSant and Harry Vassallo. In the early years, I missed those similarities, but over the past few years they have become so obvious that I can’t ignore them any more. DoctorElfridSant and Vassallo are the most incredible snobs, suffer from a superiority complex, think that they are the panacea for the ills of Maltese society, are incapable of admitting defeat or error, and have an overweening obsession with networks of friends of friends and corruption. Neither of them knows how to smile or get along with people. Both live in a world of their own making, and react with disproportionate rage when thwarted. Both derive some kind of perverse satisfaction (or sense of vindication) from seeing themselves as the victim of an unjust system. Both are the heroes in the novels they have scripted, and cannot bridge the gap between the narrative they have written for themselves and harsh reality. Both speak, write and behave as though the rest of us – real people with real lives – are actors in a film they are watching or characters in a book they are reading. In this last election campaign, even their physiognomy seemed to merge, with Harry Vassallo looking more and more like DoctorElfridSant. I wonder what it all means.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nPity Joe Mizzi’s not around to find oil for DoctorElfridSant\\nUnbelievably (or perhaps not) DoctorElfridSant is still insisting that he was right, the rest of us were wrong, and his vote-catching – ahem – proposal to cut the electricity surcharge by half would have been great.\\nHe told parliament, when he rose like phoenix from the ashes for the fourth time (or like Rasputin from the river) that this would have cost the government only between Lm10 million and Lm12 million, yet it would have spurred economic growth because people would have had more disposable income.\\nGesu-Kristu-Spirtu-Santu. First of all, you see what I mean with my remark, posted some days ago, that this man gives numbers in euros only when he wants the amount to seem scandalously large, like with the amount of tax waived by the Inland Revenue. The rest of the time, because he can’t admit that Malta joined the eurozone against his advice, he uses old money.\\nSecondly, you have to look at the unsound reasoning behind his argument. The government doesn’t earn money. It garners funds through taxation. So to pay for something, it first has to cream that money off what people earn. To subsidise oil for the generation of electricity to the tune of Lm12 million, it has to collect an additional Lm12 million in taxes, or cut public spending by Lm12 million elsewhere. Either way, that Lm12 million is going to come out of people’s pockets. So what DoctorElfridSant is saying here is that it would have been a jolly good idea to take Lm12 million from people and give it back to them – or rather, to different people – in the form of an electricity subsidy, and that way, there will be more disposable income in the market.\\nHe doesn’t see the hole in his reasoning. If you take Lm12 million from Peter in the form of income tax to avoid taking Lm12 million from Paul in the form of electricity payments, you are still taking Lm12 million out of the disposable income pool. More to the point, Paul will not have more disposable income through real earnings, but will have roughly the same disposable income that he had before the surcharge was introduced. Meanwhile, because the money taken from Peter was in the form of income tax, it is a direct assault on a real increase in disposable income through earnings. So DoctorElfridSant’s proposal would have discouraged the real growth of disposable income through earnings so as to maintain a false and static status quo of ‘disposable income’ created through the subsidy of electricity.\\nIt’s reminiscent of CET.\\n  \\n\\n\\nJoe Mizzi’s oil platform\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, May 23rd, 2008 at 2:37 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThis post is sponsored by Poodle Calendars\\nWe all know by now that DoctorJosephMuscat is a special boy, and it’s not because he’s what is known in the local vernacular as a ‘ginger’.\\nBut this time, things have gone a little too far, and he’s setting his own date for the leadership election.

His career progression has been marked by a process of sucking up to the party leader and other senior figures who he has described as his mentors. If he were a woman, the psychological pundits would have said that he has a sugar-daddy fixation. But he’s not a woman, so we’ll just have to say that he’s a teacher’s pet.\\nTeacher’s pets aren’t just boys, of course. Lots of them are girls. In my class at school, the teacher’s pets sat in the front row, hung onto every word, turned round to shush the disruptive girls talking in the back row, wore a permanent air of superiority and always rushed to play guitar for the nuns during – yawn – yet another mass. The approval of authority figures was, to them, far more important that the approval of their peers. They didn’t care a hoot that by actively currying favour with the former they incurred the mocking wrath of the latter.\\nDoes this remind you of anyone? It certainly reminds me of Doctor Joseph Muscat, who at the grand old age of 34 is still hunting down the approval of a series of male authority figures. He is the Teacher’s Pet of the Year, which is not quite the same thing as the Playboy Playmate Pet of the Year, but you get my drift. First it was Doctor Alfred Sant, whose lapdog poodle he famously became, then it was Doctor George Vella, then Mister Godfrey Grima, then Doctor Anthony Licari – all were hauled into the forum to vouch for the credibility, sanity, ability and intelligence of the man who, like Doctor Alfred Sant before him, has made Doctor the first component of a three-word moniker.\\nNow the teacher’s pet has been at it again, with a flying visit from Mister (alas, not Doctor) Martin Schultz, the chairman of the European Socialists, who just so happened to be in Malta. A press conference was called, and Doctor Joseph Muscat sat at Mister Martin Schultz’s side, wearing his best teacher’s pet expression – one that I last saw on the smug face of one of those front-row girls as she was being praised by the teacher for always doing her maths homework perfectly, unlike Daphne over there at the back who never even bothers pretending to have done it at all (oh baby, I had the last laugh).\\nThe press photographers caught images that perfectly encapsulated his immaturity: he beamed uncontrollably with pleasure and self-satisfaction as Mister Martin Schultz praised him. He doesn’t know that it is appropriate for all those of us who are older than 12 to wear a deadpan, indifferent or ever-so-slightly embarrassed expression when being subjected to fulsome or gushing praise. It is even more appropriate to attempt to get the person doing the praising to stop, by passing some sort of self-deprecating remark. It is highly inappropriate to encourage praise, and more so to ship in people and hold press conferences for the express purpose of allowing journalists to hear them praise you. Do Doctor Joseph Muscat and Mister Martin Schultz know the meaning of the word ‘cringe’? I doubt it.\\nDoctor Joseph Muscat actually believes – at the age of 34 and a married man with two children, who is attempting to become party leader and thence, prime minister – that drafting in senior politicians to give spoken testimonials to his suitability for the post is an immensely good idea. This makes me want to lie down and weep. Real men, real leaders and real politicians are taken at their own worth. The minute you feel you need to bring in some public testimonials as to your character-worthiness and your suitability for the post for which you are applying, like a job applicant asked for a reference from your last employer or departmental professor, you’re done for. The message the public receives (the intelligent public, at least) is not the one you want them to receive, but another one altogether: that you alone are not enough to convince us, that you must be bolstered by the testimonials of others, that you have the mentality of a job applicant and not of a statesman and a leader.\\nMister Martin Schultz said at the press conference: “I am here to express my support for my friend Joe, a very important member of our parliamentary group. I know Joseph Muscat as a deeply convinced pro-European.” Do you see what I mean? That’s a dead ringer for a reference written for somebody who is applying for a job. For heaven’s sake, you don’t expect to see it done for somebody who is applying for the job of prime minister. Doesn’t Doctor Joseph Muscat realise this? Apparently not, because the entire Santian wing of the Labour Party suffers from a massive social inferiority complex masked by an intellectual superiority complex, and depends heavily on the reassurance of academic qualifications and public testimonials by Important Persons. We have an unusual political situation in that the Santian Labour Party is composed almost entirely of teacher’s pets, when it is usually rebels who are attracted to Labour and the left wing. Oh but I forgot – the Labour Party is now rightwing, xenophobic, conservative and inward-looking, and therefore a perfect stomping-ground for bottom-licking creeps and teacher’s pets.\\nSo Mister Martin Schultz thinks that Doctor Joseph Muscat is a deeply convinced pro-European. That’s interesting. Does he know that Doctor Joseph Muscat abstained, spoiled his vote or voted No in the referendum on membership, in line with his mentor’s orders? Does he know that Doctor Joseph Muscat spent the entire referendum campaign writing newspaper articles that sought to convince us how EU membership would be disastrous for Malta? Does he know that Doctor Joseph Muscat, in his other incarnation as a Super One ‘journalist’ a mere five years ago, barracked politicians who favoured EU membership, and even shouted over the prime minister as he was trying to speak during a Broadcasting Authority press conference? Apparently, the ‘diplomatic skills’ that Mister Martin Schultz noted in him are a very recent acquisition, too. I do hope a reporter asked these questions at the press conference, but I have scanned the reports thoroughly and found nothing to indicate that somebody did. If Doctor Joseph Muscat is a deeply convinced pro-European then five years ago he was – what, a dumb blond obeying sugar-daddy’s orders to ensure that he wasn’t kicked out of the Playmate Pet of the Year mansion?\\nLet’s put it this way. I can’t for a moment imagine Lawrence Gonzi (or the other contenders, for that matter), flying in a Euro-politician to say how jolly good he is in the Nationalists’ leadership election four years ago. It would have been seen correctly as an erroneous strategy that detracted from his strength rather than bolstering it. The valid reasoning would have been that if you need to draft in the support of third parties to tell the public how fantastically suited you are to the post of party leader and prime minister, then you are not fantastically suited to that role at all, but rather the opposite. The public can see this. Not everybody has a pumpkin for a brain, even in the Labour Party.\\nNow, in the classic mode of the teacher’s pet, Doctor Joseph Muscat is mocked, derided, resented and despised by the rest of his class. It won’t be long before they corner him in the lavatories and give him a big wedgie. This is what happens – or used to happen, anyway – to teacher’s pets. Somebody holds them down and somebody else, in one swift movement, jerks their pants up so that – well, let’s not be too graphic. And incidentally, this is not bullying. Bullying is what happens when the weakest children are picked on. Teacher’s pets are not the weakest members of the class but those in the strongest position, because they have chosen to align themselves strategically with authority rather than with their fellow pupils and peers.\\nDoctor Joseph Muscat’s classmates have written to the President of the Party of European Socialists to complain about Mister Martin Schultz’s behaviour in singling out the teacher’s pet. “We are sure you agree that it is deeply offensive, totally irregular and highly unethical (and uncalled for) to have an official of the Party of European Socialists endorse one particular candidate, to the detriment of the other four,” they wrote. You see, this is the funny thing: in a more normal state of affairs, the testimonial of a Political Big Cheese would work against a candidate and, by default, in favour of his rivals. Testimonials merely make one look ridiculous when one is seeking the leadership of the country. Leaders are not supposed to seek the public approval of figures they believe to be more senior, important or credible than they are. They are supposed to seek the approval of the electorate by appearing strong enough not to need the testimonials of others.\\nDoctor Alfred Sant’s control of the Labour Party was a textbook case of the Revenge of the Nerd. Now we are going to be treated to the Reign of the Teacher’s Pet. What thrills – and giant wedgies – lie in store.\\nThis article was published in The Malta Independent on Sunday yesterday.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nFirst it was Martin Luther King’s ‘I have a dream’. Now DoctorJosephMuscat is seeking inspiration in an admixture of Jesus Christ (turn the other cheek; the meek shall inherit the earth) and Mahatma Gandhi (peaceful resistance).\\nHe wouldn’t comment on his rivals’ reaction to the MisterMartinSchulz debacle because “it would be cheap”. He is keen to emphasise that when he becomes leader, he will call on all four of them to give him their “24-hour” support. I imagine he will get little more than a reverse salute in return. He tells the newspapers repeatedly that he is ready and willing to work with everyone. And now here’s the latest: “If I am elected, I will strive to see the other four candidates in the heart of the party.”\\nSo what about that MisterMartinSchulz thing, then? “Martin” – golly gosh, first-name basis with the Big Boys – “is a colleague and a friend. Every socialist is my friend.” Really? Only the champagne variety, I would imagine, and not the smelly chaps down at the Lola Bar near the docks.\\nWill the Labour Party split when he’s made leader? DoctorJosephMuscat doesn’t think so: “We will remain one team. No one will be asked to leave the party.” Oh baby. You never were one team, and it’s not likely that Your Leadership (a nice new way of addressing the MLP leader, though he might insist on Your Grace) is going to change that, rather than make it worse.\\nGet used to it, Joseph. They hate your guts. They think you’re unworthy and that you have been given an unfair advantage. And I must say, I agree with them.\\nThose who sit on the fence get a prong up their butt\\nDoctorJosephMuscat has mastered his mentor DoctorAlfredSant’s crafty little way of appearing to promise people what they want while making sure he doesn’t actually have to deliver the goods. DoctorAlfredSant as prime minister had a track record of doing this, which is why he wasn’t trusted in 1998, 2003, 2008 and all the years in between.\\nNow here comes the yapping lapdog to do the same, starting with the hoary question of divorce. DoctorAlfredSant, who had his marriage annulled by the Civil Court – the Maltese ‘divorce’, except that you all have to pretend there was no marriage to begin with, which makes a mockery of years of life together – hummed and hawed about this one. He said that it was not up to the government to push divorce, but up to ‘civil society’ to start a debate. For crying out loud, that debate has been going on for the last two decades at least. Before that, we had more pressing things to think about, like keeping body and soul together.\\nNot up to the government? Who in heaven’s name pushes legislation through parliament, if not the government? So there’s the modern DoctorAlfredSant fence-sat with the rest of them, having rid himself of his own marriage by the expedient means of having it declared non-existent in the first place. Perhaps he expects all those Maltese citizens whose marriage has failed to follow his example and clog up the courts with pleas that they were pressurized into marriage/never wanted to get married in the first place/were unsuited to marriage/didn’t understand what was required of them in married life/were immature/whine/whine/whine and let’s pretend it never happened.\\nNow we have DoctorJosephMuscat, taking it up a notch by – oooooh, the adrenalin! – saying that he wants the introduction of divorce. Risky! That must have given him a thrill. Yes, but apparently he doesn’t want it enough to bring out the party whip and make sure that all Labour MPs vote in favour so that the legislation actually gets through. Oh no. We get our adrenalin rushes from saying naughty things, and not from actually doing them, don’t we? “If Labour is in government, I will put forward my own draft legislation and will give a free vote to our parliamentarians on this issue,” he told a newspaper yesterday.\\n“I will put forward my own draft legislation” – don’t take this to mean that even though he is the prime minister, he will attempt to introduce divorce through a private member’s bill (though I wouldn’t put any such circus act past him). He uses the words ‘I’ and ‘my own’ advisedly: l’Etat, c’est moi. The state, that’s me. Or perhaps he is contemplating a private member’s bill, and hasn’t yet been advised that it isn’t possible when you are the prime minister.\\nAllowing a free vote by removing the party whip is the most efficient way of ensuring that Malta remains without divorce legislation, while allowing Il-Prim Ministru DoctorJosephMuscat to pretend to himself and his electorate that he has done something about it. He will be able to say that he put forward a divorce bill but that The People, through their MPs, rejected it.\\nIf the Opposition party also gives a free vote on the bill, the legislation might just scrape through, but even then I don’t think so. If the Opposition party votes with the whip to oppose the bill, it definitely won’t get through, because there will be many MPs on the government benches who will be drawn by their Catholic consciences and their respect for holy married life to vote against it, starting from Marlene Pullicino.\\nThe anthropologist Mark-Anthony Falzon wrote an excellent piece about all this, which was published in The Sunday Times yesterday. Read it here. He wrote, in barely veiled reference to DoctorJosephMuscat:\\nThe fortunes of the sixth hat have of late risen, what with its fashion among upstarts with megalomaniacal visions. We would take the divorce issue to parliament (following a public discussion, of course) but only after decommissioning all whips and calling for a free vote. In other words, this is an admission of inability to take decisions, and a sure tactic of delay and dodging. First, ‘free’ or ‘conscience’ votes are usually reserved for life and death questions such as capital punishment, where individual morality may override any collective decisions taken by a parliamentary group. Second, given the attraction of the moral high ground – particularly in such a public place as parliament – a free vote on divorce would be a recipe for disaster in the shape of sanctimonious antics.\\nDoctorJosephMuscat should take care. Every time he opens his mouth, he confirms the impression that he is cast in the DoctorAlfredSant mould. His political sophistry on the question of divorce is just the latest example.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn today’s The Times, Lino Spiteri writes about MisterMartinSchulz’s strategic error in endorsing DoctorJosephMuscat. (In marketing-speak, when a well-known person promotes a product by saying that he’s used it and it does what it says on the label, that’s called a testimonial.) Dominic Fenech posted this comment beneath the on-line version of the article.\\nThe question that begs itself is, what’s in it for the endorser? Martin Schulz didn’t get to be where he is by doing anything for nothing. Does the kingmaker hope to gain control over the king’s men in the EP eventually? I’m sure it’s the last thing Joseph Muscat had in mind, but at this level of play, favours once done will be called.\\nPerhaps. And perhaps not. What was in it for Sant when he made Muscat his pet poodle and court favourite? Nothing that I can think of. Muscat strikes me as one of those characters who flirts outrageously with men in the same way that he might do with women, flattering them, telling them they’re right, making them feel wonderful and then getting what he wants. I’m not imputing that anyone is homosexual here. I am merely taking note of something that I have long since observed: that there is a certain kind of straight young(ish) man who shows no compunction about flirting with other men, usually older and more powerful ones, who are also straight, in exactly the same way that a certain kind of woman would do, as a means to an end. The extraordinary thing is that straight men respond to it – but as my cynical friend said, what’s to be surprised at?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nAt the risk of being on the receiving end of a wedgie in the school lavatories, like DoctorJosephMuscat, I have to say that my sole reaction on reading the Labour Party’s ‘why we lost’ report was ‘I told you so.’\\nThe report contained nothing that I hadn’t already written about in great detail in a whole series of newspaper columns, and on this blog, during the last campaign and on and off since 1996. But here’s the thing: when I spelled out in excruciating detail – far more detail, in fact, than the ‘why we lost’ report – what Labour was doing wrong, I was called an evil witch who hates Laburisti and who wants to see the Nationalists re-elected so that I may continue to sit in my cosy little coven. (As an aside, it’s fascinating to see the expression on the faces of the little weasels who meet me for the first time after describing me as a witch, only to discover that I am a great deal better-looking than they are – and taller.) None of these paranoid people bothered to take note of the fact that in this sector at least, mine is a professional opinion and not just the opinion of yet another newspaper columnist.\\nDuring the election campaign, I had an instant verdict on how each of Labour’s tactics would affect its fortunes at the polls. There isn’t much I can say I am good at, but this is one of the few things for which I appear to have an unerring instinct. Throughout the campaign I sat glued to the various broadcast, print and electronic media and watched the ebb of Labour’s votes and the flow of Lawrence Gonzi’s fortune. It was really quite extraordinary. Before the campaign, Labour’s star was in the ascendant – an important point that the report failed to make – but as soon as the campaign began, the Nationalist Party started to close the gap.\\nI’m not going through all the incidents that I saw at the time as decisive moments that would contribute to Labour’s defeat. It is a mistake to imagine that it was only the big things and the major issues that contributed to the party’s failure at the polls, like the Nationalists’ successful tactic of harping on for weeks about the so-called repeater class. For example, I have no doubt that thousands of people made their final decision on how to vote when they watched the television footage of Sant cowering beneath the Crosscraft set in the PBS studios, arms folded defensively, calling for the police to protect him against an MP (whatever the MP may have done). For voters, it was a decisive moment. There was another such decisive moment when Sant addressed a mass meeting in windy conditions, with his wig standing on end like a cock’s-comb, shouting out a nonsensical speech with a furious expression. If you make the mistake of thinking that was just something minor, then your grasp of these matters is about as strong as the Labour Party’s.\\nThe political leaders’ debate at the university marked another electoral point-of-no-return for Labour. Sant’s performance, greeted by booing and heckling, was bad enough, but in its attempts at turning this to its advantage by attacking students, the party actually dug itself in so deep that it couldn’t climb back out. Super One went mad. George Vella became abusive. And I don’t know what political marketing guru thought that he could win votes from dithering Nationalists by using the Labour Party’s massive media machine to attack and intimidate a 19-year-old private citizen so as to get at his mother, the Public Enemy No. 1 author of this blog. It backfired massively. Many of those dithering Nationalists were so disgusted – not at the expression ‘Fuck off’, which is normal usage in these circles, but at the bullying and harassment – that it helped them make up their minds. The communications gurus at the Labour Party didn’t even have the nous to realise that the most effective way to scare people off is by attacking one of their own. This, too, was obvious to me when it happened, but the Labour Party had to wait for the ‘why we lost’ report to find out. I remember telling my son at the time not to worry about it, and though he hated seeing himself exposed and bullied on Super One in that manner, he should take pride in the fact that every time Super One played that clip, Alfred Sant’s party lost more votes.\\nIt is astonishing that all these things, which were immediately obvious to the people working on the Nationalist Party’s campaign, were not also obvious to the movers and shakers in the Labour Party. They were not even obvious after the election was lost. The party had to commission a report by specialists to tell it where it went wrong, when the people tracking things on the PN side knew exactly where the Labour Party was going wrong every minute of every day of the campaign, and tailoring their tactics accordingly. That is the most shocking aspect of the Labour Party’s failure: that the report which they have now received, and which was prepared after research and investigation, could have been written in a single sitting by any one of the more senior people working on the PN campaign – during the campaign itself, and not with the benefit of hindsight.\\nIn battle, and political battles are no exception, it is crucial to know your enemy. Yet the ‘why we lost’ report tackles Labour’s electoral loss in a vacuum, instead of placing it in the context of a battle against a tactically well-prepared adversary. There is virtually no reference in this report to the tactics and methods employed by the Nationalist Party, yet it seems obvious to me that Labour’s failure has to be measured against the Nationalists’ success, because general elections are a zero-sum game. When studying the way your party failed, you must also study the way the other party won. Taking the easy way out by blaming it on the power of incumbency is just another way of saying that you’re not interested in understanding how things are done.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nWe wondered what that ballerina was all about in Labour’s campaign. Now we know, because the ‘why we lost’ report has told us. The Labour campaign was built around the symbolic imagery of a girl blossoming into a young woman who ‘looks in a fresh direction….a new beginning.’ The message wasn’t understood, the report notes. Well, that’s the understatement of the year.\\nAnd let’s be honest about it. What young woman would look with anything other than apprehension at a new direction in which a 60-year-old man in a wig loomed leeringly? Whoever came up with that one deserves to be stood against a wall and shot.\\nPerhaps I can say at this point just how much hilarity was provoked in the Nationalist Party campaign HQ by the various ballerinas, couples bent around upended containers, and Wella-girl shampoo models with come-and-shag-me expressions. Every time a new one went up, there were jokes and snorts of laughter and people driving round to take a look at the way the various parts of the models’ bodies were draped around the right angles of the containers. It afforded a bit of distraction from all the tension.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, May 27th, 2008 at 12:05 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Labour seemed to think that it would win by default, because the polls showed that people wanted a change. This meant that the party never bothered to find out what sort of change people wanted.”\\nAlfred Sant decided “he didn’t need to talk through the opinion polls unless there was something that didn’t square with what the party was ‘feeling’ during the campaign.”\\nWhen Super One reporters “stuck their microphones into the faces of Nationalist politicians” they came across as aggressive harassers and this “eroded the party’s credibility with floaters and particularly with the youth vote.” This was especially the case when students were criticised by Super One news after the university debate.\\nLabour columnists writing for The Times and The Malta Independent demonstrated “lack of writing skills and an inability to put forward an argument, and this reinforced negative perceptions of Labour protagonists.”\\n“Electors who had never voted Labour asked themselves how they could possibly do so when the party appeared to have no control over its executive members, even at the highest level” – a reference to Alfred Sant\\nSant’s re-election in 2003 “did away with the party’s sense of security and confidence.” His reinstatement was viewed as “an act of sabotage against the party”, and over time, the atmosphere of resentment developed into a black comedy of suspicion and paranoia.”\\nSant “did not have the strength or moral authority to stop the rot”.\\nAt the university debate and at the PBS studios confrontation with Pullicino Orlando, Sant was seen as “weak, running away from confrontation and losing control of the situation.”\\nSant always appeared in public with a group of the party’s highest officials and never alone, giving a confused impression as to who was really leading the party.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nAlfred Sant said in parliament that an influential network of people who control the Nationalist Party is now trying to hijack the Labour Party. Somebody posted a comment beneath an on-line report of his speech: “The Labour Party has been hijacked for a long time, Mr Sant.”\\nFrans Sammut, the author and former adviser to Prime Minister Sant at Castille, posted this comment beneath an on-line story about MisterMartinSchulz’s endorsement of DoctorJosephMuscat: “I was and still am in favour of partnership with the EU rather than full membership. I stated this in public, wrote a book about it and am still very much of the same opinion. Fat lot of good has EU membership done us! But now that we are irrevocably in, I would rather have a party leader who knows how the EU works than somebody who has no inkling, except for the usual presumption some people parade around, assuming nobody can see through their façade. Besides, I would prefer having a leader heading for elections at 39 than somebody over 65. Naturally, the people on the other side of the fence would prefer a 65-year-old opponent whom they can patronisingly pat on the back as ‘good ol’ nannu’ than a fresh young Turk raring to go. Like Mr Schulz I wish Dr Muscat well. There are other contestants whom I consider highly qualified for leadership, and expect them to graciously fall behind Dr Muscat’s leadership after June 5. They are all sorely needed to save this corruption-ridden place we call the Republic of Malta.”\\nAnother comment posted beneath the same story: “Dear Dr Muscat, please do not, for the sake of the MLP, keep ending your interviews with ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating.’ If there is one phrase that will link you indelibly with Dr Sant it is that. Tell your campaign manager to come up with an original if you want true credibility as your own man.”\\nBeneath the same story, there were these fawning comments: “Dr Muscat’s record in the EU parliament confirms that he is the New Star of Maltese Politics.” And: “The most important thing about Joe is that he knows how to smile. He must be really worrying most of all the PN strategists. They are the ones who are doing their best to push other candidates in this race with the hope that later they will have enough fire power to shoot at.” Well, actually the PN strategists are already at work, researching all those nice articles that the New Star of Maltese Politics wrote about how terrible EU membership will be for Malta. They’re really hoping that Joseph Muscat will be elected, because George Abela will mean a straight contest.\\nLabour MP Anthony Agius Decelis paid tribute to Sant in parliament, saying that he deserves credit for ridding Maltese politics – Maltese politics, note, not the Labour Party – of violence and bullying. Well, if that’s the only thing they can praise him for in 16 long, grinding years…\\n“Whenever I asked to discuss the surveys, and I did this many times, the leader would say ‘We don’t need to discuss the surveys unless we’re doing badly.’ The implication was that we were doing well, wasn’t it? And so I never got to see the surveys” – Labour’s deputy leader, Michael Falzon. Somebody should tell Sant that surveys are always discussed, whether the party is faring well or badly.\\nThe original Labour Party electoral campaign plan included a proposal for Alfred Sant to hold on-line chat sessions with young people. Oh God, my sides! This is the man who doesn’t own a mobile phone because he doesn’t like the idea of people being able to reach you whenever they want to. This is the man who doesn’t like or understand young people. On-line chat sessions!\\n“The rigidity and lack of clear and coordinated purpose brought about the sort of mixed messages the party’s leaders were sending, with a brand that portrayed a modern and dynamic party while speeches included gaffes such as Dr Sant’s ‘Gooonzi’ speech, Charles Mangion’s mention of different DNA and Michael Falzon’s chants of ‘lions of change’…..In fact, the weeks before the March 8 election reinforced the perception that if the party could not run a campaign it could hardly be fit to run the country, the report notes.” – The Times, 24 May – Revealed: report on Labour defeat\\nThe ‘why we lost’ report points out that the Labour Party’s election campaign strategy group was made up of the actual people on the campaign trail – oh God, my sides again! – and included the deputy leaders, who were also fighting their own personal election campaigns as MPs. This meant that Labour’s strategy group, the report remarks po-facedly, found it difficult to evaluate what the Nationalist Party was doing and react in time.\\nThe report also says that there seems to have been no attempt to analyse the electorate, not even the 32,000 or so new voters, and that “prominent members of the party who form part of the leadership” were not even familiar with the figures. Yes, we saw that Jason make a hash of it on Xarabank.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nEvarist Bartolo has said that of those Maltese citizens who live elsewhere, only the ones who pay tax here should be allowed to vote in general elections. He has misunderstood the meaning of the slogan ‘No taxation without representation,’ which was coined by the Reverend Jonathan Mayhew, who used it in a sermon in Boston in the mid-18th century. It doesn’t mean that only those who pay taxes can vote. It means that people should not be taxed unless they are represented in parliament. It is an argument against the taxation of the disenfranchised, and not an argument as to who can and cannot vote.\\nEvarist is still harping on about the same thing: that most of those ‘brought over to Malta to vote’ were Nationalist. I have news for Ev. They weren’t brought over to Malta. They came of their own free will, and lots of them paid the full fare for the privilege of getting here in time to vote against Labour. If those who wanted to vote against Labour were more motivated than those who wanted to vote for Labour, then that’s the Labour Party’s problem and not something for which the government can or should be blamed. Obviously, the prospect of Alfred Sant as prime minister was not enough incentive to bring Maltese Labour supporters rushing back here from their homes overseas to vote for the reds. I can’t say I blame them.\\nEvarist claims that 4,200 such people caught cheap Air Malta flights and came back to vote for the Nationalists. Well, excuse me Mr Prying Eyes, but how do you know for which party they voted? Were you in the polling-booth with them? Or have you just drawn your own conclusions based on social background? Funny how we have data protection in everything but voter records: the dreadful Sant actually placed on the table of the House a list of all the people he claims came over from abroad to vote PN. He doesn’t mind invading the personal space of private citizens. He only minds when people invade his, even though he’s the leader of the Opposition.\\nSo Ev’s conclusion is that if he is elected party leader – some chance, given that he trails in all the polls – he will make sure that only taxpayers vote, except for diplomats working abroad (oh, don’t diplomats pay tax, then?) and students at overseas colleges and universities. He describes this as a ‘principle of democracy’. Now I wonder where he learned his principles of democracy: oh yes, at the feet of Dom Mintoff.\\nThis strikes me as a return to the days when only those who owned property could vote. Now according to Ev it’s only those who pay taxes, which means only those who have earnings. So what about housewives, students, the unemployed, those on social benefits, those who are not liable to income tax because they earn a low salary (and who are most likely to be Labour supporters)? Ev – what a surprise – hasn’t thought this one through.\\nOh, and there’s another thing. We’re part of Schengen now, which means that we can move around within Schengen territory as though we are at home in our own country. How is Ev, in all his great wisdom, going to chart our myriad comings and goings? How will he even know whether we live here or elsewhere? And more to the point, why on earth should he consider it the business of his political party to spy on us and find out?\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, May 27th, 2008 at 12:15 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe Labour Party’s ‘electoral commission’ has banned the five leadership contenders from participating in the television show Xarabank this Friday. Before doing this, it first allowed them – gee, thanks – to participate as long as (1) there was no audience, (2) the show was recorded instead of going out live, and (3) the recording was handed over to Lejber’s ‘electoral commission’ for censorship before being broadcast.\\nJoe Azzopardi hit the roof, of course. He argued that the show has been transmitted live with an audience from day one, and he doesn’t see why he should change this just to keep Lejber’s ‘electoral commission’ happy. More to the point, he will not submit to censorship by the Labour Party. Damn right. It’s about time these paranoid, dictatorial and authoritarian people climbed out of their hole and joined the real world.\\nWhen their outrageous conditions were refused outright, Lejber’s ‘electoral commission’ stamped their little feet and said, mela issa they’re not going to allow anyone to participate, hekk. Four of the contenders bowed their heads to the will of these throw-backs and said nothing, which is not a good sign in a potential prime minister. And George Abela, of course, objected and said that he won’t agree to censorship. Ah, but here’s the thing: Lejber says that any contender who defies its instructions and goes on the show will be banned from running for election. So Abela is faced with Hobson’s choice: either he goes on the show to promote his cause and ends up losing his cause altogether, or he does something that goes completely against the grain – difficult if not impossible for somebody with such a strong character – and bows and scrapes to the ‘electoral commission’ with Joseph Muscat and the rest of them, which will make him look equally craven.\\nAnd here we see yet more evidence of how the Lejber Party has been run for years, which is why it has failed miserably at everything it has tried to do.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOne of the authors of the Labour Party’s ‘why we lost report’ is Godfrey Pirotta, who is listed on DoctorJosephMuscat’s website as one of his backers and supporters, from way back when he campaigned to become an MEP. Hbieb tal-hbieb tal-hbieb tal-hbieb tal-hbieb…..\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOccasionally, things happen that remind me just how backward and undeveloped Maltese society is, and how unsophisticated its thinking. I have followed the attempts at justifying Martin Schulz’s endorsement of Joseph Muscat, and what shocks me most is that many people cannot see it for what it is. Several people have argued that ‘endorsements are the norm’. Yes, they are. But only when those doing the endorsing share the same citizenship as those they are endorsing.\\nArguments can be tested by taking them to the extreme. Would Martin Schulz ever consider flying to London to tell a gathering of the British national press, when Gordon Brown finally flunks out, who he thinks is the best choice for Labour Party leader – with that man sitting by his side? Of course not. Just imagine Britain’s reaction if a bloody German flew in to tell the Labour Party who would make the best new leader and, eventually, prime minister. That contender’s campaign would be dead in the water at once. And it would never occur to somebody campaigning for the leadership of a British political party to consider such a stratagem. And if he did, it wouldn’t be just the press that would rip him to shreds all over the front pages and in a zillion commentaries, but the Labour Party itself. Ask yourself why, and there you have your answer as to why Joseph Muscat and Martin Schulz behaved abominably and showed themselves to be unfit for office.\\nA politician will only fly in to interfere in the leadership election of a political party of a country not his own when (1) the country or organisation he represents (in this case, both) are larger and stronger than the country and organisation in which he is interfering, and (2) the country which he is visiting to interfere is considered inferior in the colonialist manner, allowing him to believe there is nothing wrong with patronising a political party there. Martin Schulz feels comfortable patronising the Labour Party in tin-pot Malta, but he would never for one moment consider patronising the Labour Party in Britain, and if he tried to patronise a political party in Italy, he would find himself with Silvio Berlusconi’s boot up his backside.\\nMartin Schulz’s gesture was completely ill-advised and unethical, Joseph Muscat demonstrated that he thinks of himself, his party and his country as inferior by inviting such patronising behaviour, and the Labour Party shows itself to have been hijacked by Joseph Muscat and his own personal patron when it fails to censure his action. In the mind of the Labour Party, if it has a mind, it’s all right for a contender to import the opinion of foreign politicians and hold a public circus that draws down opprobrium, but it is not OK for all the contenders to go on a television show together.\\nThose who make comparisons with the endorsements of politicians in the USA and elsewhere are missing the crucial point that the people making those endorsements are citizens of the same country in which the election is being held, and in the case of a general election, they will be voting. In other words, they share the citizenship of the politician they are endorsing and have a direct interest in how the country or party is run. The same cannot be said of a politician flown in from elsewhere, which causes us to ask: what’s in it for Martin Schulz? And more to the point, who paid his airfare?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe U-turn specialist has executed another spectacular three-point-turn in the middle of our busy political highway. Last seen preening himself at a press conference with My Mate Martin Schulz at his side, his face aglow with self-satisfied delight, Herr Doktor Joseph Muscat has announced his ‘cancellation’ of the endorsement.\\nYes, that’s right. He’s cancelled it. Hands over ears, eyes tight shut, na-na-na-na-na; I’m not hearing you and it doesn’t exist anymore, so there. Herr Doktor was traumatised by the reaction when he brought over his nice little German playmate to tell the cameras: “I tried this product and I liked it. You should try it, too.” Andie McDowell does it for L’Oreal’s Deep Set Wrinkles cream. Martin Schulz does it for Herr Doktor Joseph Muscat. The only difference, Herr Doktor’s fans would have us believe, is that Andie McDowell is prettier than Martin Schulz and Joseph Muscat is not a face-cream.\\nAh, but there’s more. Herr Doktor had a whole series of MEPs lined up to fly to Malta to sit by his side in front of the cameras and say: “Joseph Muscat worked for my wrinkles. Try him on yours.” And he’s cancelled them, too. Either he’s of the reaction, or he’s just realized that he came across as a prat and not as an admired and respected politician, which is what he was hoping for. He says that he doesn’t want any more acrimony. Well, I have news for him. If he plans to be party leader and prime minister, he’s got years of acrimony ahead of him, and if he can’t cope with this little bit of nuisance, he’s going to crumble within months like his hero did.\\nThe other day around the supper-table at home we had a bit of an argument. Three were of the opinion that Herr Doktor knows exactly what he is doing, and is aware of the diplomatic implications of having a foreign politician campaign for you in your own country – but he doesn’t care because he has made a strategic decision to focus only on impressing the delegates. The delegates will be impressed by all these Big Europeans Who Like Joseph, and if the public hates it, then he has another five years to win the public round. The other two of us disagreed. We thought Herr Doktor really and truly didn’t know what he was doing, and that he is so politically clueless that he actually thought there would be no backlash and no implications on a wider scale. To him, it was the political equivalent of a wrinkle-cream endorsement by an actor. What’s the fuss? Is anyone screaming in the newspapers about Andie McDowell?\\nToday’s news that he had a whole line-up of MEPs ready to endorse him, drip by drip, for the remainder of the campaign gives weight to that last argument. The kid really doesn’t have a clue. And I use the word ‘kid’ advisedly, because I know lots of men and women of 34 who are 10 times more mature and astute than he is. Brussels or no Brussels, PhD or no PhD, he is astonishingly unworldly and lacking in sophistication.\\nA newspaper journalist who got wind of the line-up called Herr Doktor and asked to know who his mates the MEPs were. Herr Doktor wouldn’t say, though he did confirm that he had called off his plans to haul them over. I would have loved, loved, loved to get an answer to the question of who was going to pay for all these business class flights to Malta, and for their hotels. Were they going to come here at Herr Doktor’s expense? At their own expense? Or off the back of an unsuspecting EU public?\\nIt wasn’t the opinion of the general public that put Herr Doktor off his plans. It was the angry reaction of his rival contenders. If he was any way sharper than my butter-knife, he could have foreseen that reaction. It doesn’t take the brain of Stephen Hawking to do it; it just takes commonsense. But as we have seen over the last 30-odd years, the Labour Party and many of those appended to it have become progressively, and strangely, detached from reality. They just seem unable to read common codes of behaviour. They have no idea what the words ‘emotional intelligence’ mean. And God help any man among them who demonstrates such alien traits, like George Abela, for his name is Mincemeat.\\nAnd like his mentor, Herr Doktor continues to insist that he is right, while at the same time cancelling his plans. Endorsements like this are common practice in democratic countries, he said. Democratic countries, eh? As opposed to what, China? Yes, he’s right. They are common practice. But the endorser and the endorsed always have one thing in common: citizenship of the same state. You will never get a German politician endorsing a contender for the leadership of the British Labour Party, or a Russian parliamentarian endorsing a potential Italian prime minister. Herr Doktor’s little elves are rushing forward to defend him by saying that Barack Obama was endorsed. Yes, by fellow Americans who have a direct interest in how their country is run, and not by Germans. Not that I have anything against Germans, but Malta – like Britain, France and Italy – has a great deal of historical baggage in this regard. Witness Silvio Berlusconi’s admittedly offensive comment in, what a coincidence, My Mate Martin’s regard.\\nI love Joseph Muscat. That’s right. He’s turning out to be as good a subject as the man on the other end of the lead. If he’s elected, I’m in clover. I foresee a full five years of pratfalls.\\nThis article is published today in The Malta Independent.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWell, well, well – what a surprise. The Labour Party – and will we please stop saying ‘the Labour Party’s electoral commission’ because this is the party itself we are talking about – is not content with just banning the five contenders from going out live on Xarabank. It is not content with insisting that the producers change the format of the show to suit it, record the proceedings and hand over the DVD for censorship before the broadcast. Oh no. This is the Malta Labour Party we are talking about, remember?\\nNow the party’s Great Controllers want Xarabank to hand over the recordings that have already been made of ‘a day in the life of’ Joseph Muscat, George Abela and Evarist Bartolo. The Great Controllers have ordered Xarabank not to broadcast those features. Or else.\\nOr else what? The Labour Party doesn’t know. It is so accustomed to charging around threatening people and bossing them into submission, that it has failed to distinguish between those it can control (its own people) and those it can’t (the rest of the country). Just listen to the unbelievable hogwash that shows quite clearly that the Labour Party has inched forward since 1984: “While the presenter has every right to retain the format of the programme” – oh gee, thanks, Lejber – “the Malta Labour Party and its electoral commission have a right to safeguard the interests of the party.”\\nSo what’s all the fuss about? Free campaigning is not allowed, that’s what. Not content with dictating to Union Press, Super One, KullHadd and Maltastar.com about the way in which they may or may not give exposure to leadership contenders, Labour is now seeking to control the exposure these people get in the non-party media, and even on the state broadcaster. Unbelievable? Not really. We’ve seen much worse, after all.\\nSo, because Michael Falzon and Marie Louise Coleiro refused to have a ‘day in the life’ feature made about them for Xarabank (I don’t blame them; I would hate it), Labour is trying to ban the broadcast of the ‘day in the life’ features of the other three. Doesn’t it realise that the country is gagging to see a day in the life of Joseph Muscat? He wakes up, changes Etoile’s and Soleil’s nappies, checks his emails, puts a load in the tumble-dryer, cooks breakfast for his wife, then pulls on his tights and cape and saves the world.\\nFortunately, Xarabank is not going to be bossed around by Lejber. It’s too bad that I’m going to miss it. I’ll be at the premiere of Sex and the City, far, far away from the sight and sound of megalomaniac poodles.\\nIs Joseph Muscat a big girl’s blouse as well as a poodle?\\nI ask this because he appears to have gone sobbing to Martin Schulz for defence against the ferocious attacks of the right-wing press. This is how Poul Rasmussen, president of the party of European Socialists, explained the matter in a reply to Michael Falzon’s angry missive.\\nHe said that his party does not take positions on the suitability of somebody or other for the leadership of one of its member parties, and that Schulz was just defending Muscat “from attacks in the rightwing press”.\\nReally? That’s not what the press conference heard. They heard Schulz say what a highly suitable person Muscat is, what a good leader he will make. The man is so ill-informed he doesn’t even know that it is Labour which is the rightwing party in Malta, and the Labour press is the rightwing press. Schulz seems to toil under the delusion that if a party calls itself socialist and leftwing, then that is what it is, regardless of its policies.\\nMaybe Schulz would like to explain how a xenophobic policy of opposition to EU membership and ‘keeping out the hordes’ was in any way in line with socialist, leftwing principles? Maybe Schulz should know that his pet Joseph didn’t vote Yes in the referendum on membership. But perhaps if Joseph cries at his feet a little bit, he’ll forgive the flibbertigibbet.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nToday is wrap-up day for Taste magazine, so I’m out of on-line circulation.

He told them what a good and unifying leader he will make, and that ‘an opinion survey’ puts him as the favourite among everyone – except those who voted for the Nationalist Party. Here’s the relevant bit from The Times report:\\nReferring to an opinion survey, he welcomed the fact that he was shown as being the preferred candidate among Labourites, floating votes, those who had voted for the small parties and those who had not voted at all, as well as young people, saying it appeared his message was getting through.\\nWould this survey have been carried out and interpreted by the same people who produced Labour’s surveys in the run-up to the election, the ones that told them they would win by 20,000 votes? I ask because all the surveys I have seen (they were published) put George Abela as the favourite among floating voters, those who voted for the small parties, and those who didn’t vote at all – the very people, in fact, that the Labour Party needs to get into government.\\nMaybe DoctorJosephMuscat, like DoctorAlfredSant before him, is taking it for granted that the Labour delegates are his intellectual inferiors and that they don’t read newspapers. Maybe it’s a safe assumption to make, but it’s condescending to be so blatant about it.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nA Maltese woman who was born a man, and whose birth certificate has been changed so as to – in the words of the court – protect her privacy, is being prevented from getting married. This case has been going on for some time now, since the director of the public registry refused to publish the banns for her intended marriage.\\nContrary to the popular romantic notion, you can’t just rush off and get married on impulse. The banns must first be published a few weeks ahead of the date to give people time to come forward with their reasons why the marriage should not take place. These must be reasonable objections – for example, he is married already – and not unreasonable ones, like ‘I fancy her myself.’ Nowadays, the banns are put up on a notice-board at the public registry, but in earlier times, they were read out on three successive Sundays in church in the parishes where the betrothed lived.\\nIn this woman’s case, it was the director of the public registry who raised an objection, even before the banns were out. And when the director objects to the marriage and refuses permission, you can’t get married, because he is the one who decides these things. His objection is that the woman’s birth certificate may give her gender as female, but she was born male, and as far as he is concerned, she is a man masquerading as a woman. This means that she can’t marry a man.\\nYou might ask how the director knows that her birth certificate was changed after what is now known as gender reassignment surgery. That’s because the public registry takes note of all changes to birth certificates and they go down on the record. It’s the same with adopted children. The birth certificate is changed to give the names of the adopted parents instead of the biological parents, but a note is taken and though the data is protected, the director of the public registry would have access to it – obviously.\\nSo now we have a civil liberties problem here, with the director of the public registry using information to which he is privy to argue his case that a woman who is described as such on her birth certificate has no right to marry a man because he knows that she had a sex change.\\nIt’s a civil liberties problem because this woman has a birth certificate that gives her gender as female. The birth certificate is an official document issued by the state. It should be the final word, and not subject to querulous objections or further investigation by public officers. If the director of the public registry can do this, then so can anyone else, and that birth certificate is worthless.\\nBut it isn’t worthless, because it is the very document she needs to get married to a man anywhere else in the world, and the state was aware of this when it gave her the certificate that identifies her as a woman. No public registry anywhere else is going to object on the grounds that she had a sex change, because they won’t know about it – and in any case, in many parts of Europe those who have had a sex change can marry. The director of the public registry in Malta, on the other hand, is in the unique position of having access to this woman’s personal data, and he appears to be using it to back up what seems to be his own personal morality in refusing permission to marry. If he thinks that people who have had a sex change shouldn’t be allowed to get married, that’s his problem. He has no business using his official position to grind a moral axe, if that is really what he is doing. And if it is not his own personal morality, then why in heaven’s name didn’t he just let it go? Anything that adds to the sum total of human happiness is not to be fought against.\\nThis was the first time that the public registry was faced with a case of this nature, and the matter went to court. Last year, the Civil Court ruled that the woman could marry a man because she is identified as female on her birth certificate. The judge ordered the director of the public registry to publish the banns. The director appealed against this decision, and yesterday, he won. The judge said that Maltese law allows marriage to take place between a man and a woman but does not define what makes a man a man and a woman a woman. He relied on the evidence of various independent medical experts who said that a person’s sex is determined by chromosomes, and by anatomical and psychological make-up. After a great deal of consideration, he concluded that the woman couldn’t be considered truly a woman in terms of the Marriage Act.\\nIf we’re talking strictly about chromosomes, this is correct. All the gender reassignment surgery and hormone treatment in the world can’t change male chromosomes into female chromosomes, so men who become women continue to have male chromosomes, and women who become men continue to have female ones. But we’re not talking about chromosomes here. We’re talking about two people who are free to get married and who want to marry each other – good news in these dire days. Yet the separate powers of this land are tripping over each other trying to find ways to prevent them from doing so. Why? Why not just let them get married, given that nobody is going to be hurt in the fall-out and no harm will be done? I can’t shake off the perception that this is somebody’s moral crusade.\\nI wrote about the case when it was in the news last year, pointing out that this individual was being denied the right to marry, and that the arguments of the director of the public registry were self-contradictory. On the one hand, he said that she can’t marry a man because she isn’t a woman. On the other hand, he implied that he wouldn’t allow her to marry a woman, either, because she isn’t a man and her birth certificate identifies her as a woman.\\nInterestingly, the appeal judge was struck by the same contradiction. He raised questions about what exactly the director the public registry was saying: that the woman can’t marry at all, or that she can marry a woman instead, given that he considered her to be a man? The judge reached the conclusion that the director thinks that somebody who undergoes gender reassignment surgery can marry no one. And yet the court found in the director’s favour.\\nYou see, this is what foxes me. If she can’t marry a man because she’s a man, then it follows that she can marry a woman. It’s either that, or the state is issuing fraudulent birth certificates for the express purpose of deceiving others.\\nIf she can’t marry a woman either, on the grounds that she is – what, a woman? – then it follows that she can marry a man. The director’s argument that she can’t marry a man because she is a man herself falls immediately he begins to argue that she can’t marry a woman either because she is not a man. To prevent this woman from marrying, he has to argue – and prove – that she is neither a woman nor a man. He didn’t do that, yet the court ruled in his favour, overturning the earlier judgement on the grounds that it was based on the ‘unrealistic premise’ that the two parties to the aborted marriage were not of the opposite sex. Well, if they’re not of the opposite sex, then they’re of the same sex – making this person a man who can marry a woman. But apparently not – because the Civil Court and the director of the public registry have between them created a special class of person of ambiguous gender – literally, a bridegroom – who cannot marry anyone at all.\\nThe behaviour of the director of the public registry is disquieting. Yes, he has the power to over-rule decisions to marry, but in the contemporary world, surely he should be limiting this power to ensuring that there is no bigamy or incestuous marriages. If a woman comes along with a birth certificate that says she is a woman, is it his business to enquire further and discover that she had a sex change, to refuse permission for the marriage and, when he loses the case, to take it to appeal? It’s like a moral crusade, and it makes me squeamish.\\nNow here’s a thought. This woman can get married elsewhere, and return to Malta married. What happens then? This is aside from the fact that in the long run we’re all dead, and there is nothing to be gained from denying these two people a small chance at happiness while they’re alive. It seems to me to be little more than the pointless exertion of power over others just for the sheer hell of it.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe more we hear about the Labour Party’s travails, the more we wonder why Michael Falzon didn’t just give the lot of them a reverse salute and walk out with a clear head, peace of mind and his dignity intact.\\nIt is increasingly apparent that the party bosses subjected him to ritual humiliation and to the kind of ostracism most of us last saw happening in the schoolyard. ‘Let’s not tell Michael.’ ‘Let’s leave Michael out.’ ‘Let’s do this before Michael gets to know about it.’ ‘Make sure Michael doesn’t find out.’\\nHow did he stand it? And there he was, standing up at mass meetings to defend the lot of them by saying that they were Labour United. Well, now it’s payback time, apparently. The latest is that he has dismissed the party’s claim that there was general agreement about the election campaign billboards, particularly the ‘corruption’ billboard that won the party 16 libel suits. Michael Falzon has called that a blatant lie.\\nHe said that the only one he saw was the infamous ‘corruption’ one and that he had told his colleagues that it was libellous. They told him that he had a ‘conflict of interest’. How, why and in what? They said they would ask another lawyer for advice (when any journalist or editor could have worked it out, for heaven’s sake). While Michael was still under the impression that they were waiting for this other lawyer’s advice, he was out driving at night when he drove past the billboard. They had it printed and put up behind his back, and didn’t even have the decency to let him know before he saw it for himself.\\nMichael Falzon also had plenty to say about the Labour Party’s obsession with negative campaigning, and the failure of the ‘why we lost’ reporter-writers to point this out. “I don’t attack my political adversaries by name,” he said. “Why didn’t they mention the correspondence I passed to them dated 29 May 2006 in which I was told off for not using words like ‘barons’ and ‘friends of friends’? Who were the (Labour) journalists who gave us a negative image?”\\nMichael – and remember that he was and is the party’s deputy leader – wasn’t told either that Michael Woods would be starring at the party conference before the election. Remember that televised scene in which he shouted out ‘Hawn hu!’ from the audience when Sant mentioned his name, and got a round of applause? That really lost them votes, but they couldn’t see it. Sant probably imagined that his intellectual inferiors, for which read the rest of the population, would be too stupid to work out that Woods had turned against the government because his brother, a former health ministry official, was implicated in a bribery scandal.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe London newspapers today all have the same story on the front pages: Robert Mugabe causes scandal by going to the UN food summit.\\nSome people don’t understand the meaning of the words ‘grotesque brass neck’, but I suppose if you’re the sort of person who thinks nothing of destroying your country and provoking murder and mayhem, you’re not going to give a stuff what people think of your nerve.\\nSo Mugabe landed in Rome yesterday, one of more than 60 world leaders at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s summit, to a flood of international protests. He’s with his wife Grace, who snapped up the chance for a little European travel and shopping out of her base on the Via Veneto. The Mugabes are banned from travelling to any member state of the European Union, but this EU sanction doesn’t hold for UN meetings on UN premises. So while his people starve because of his rabid policies, Robert and Grace Mugabe have used the excuse of a UN food summit to take a little break in Rome.\\nLord Malloch-Brown, the British Foreign Office minister for Africa, said: “Robert Mugabe going to Rome for the food summit is like Pol Pot going to a human rights convention.”\\nIn Zimbabwe, there is a state of formalised anarchy – a contradiction in terms but one that describes best what is happening. Death squads roam the land, people starve, and two days ago, the tortured corpse of one of Mugabe’s most courageous opponents, Tonderai Ndina, was found, weeks after he had been dragged from his home in his underwear. Inflation is running at 165,000%, and no, there’s no typo there.\\nRobert Mugabe is 84 years old. It is people like him who make non-believers wish they could hope for hell.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nAnd the suspense goes on. George Abela, Michael Falzon, Marie Louise Coleiro Preca and Evarist Bartolo together got more than 50% of the vote, which means that tomorrow the delegates will have to vote again and it will be a straight fight between George Abela and Joseph Muscat.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nMalta is agog with the surprise news of Joseph Muscat’s election victory……well, hardly. Writing this in a hotel room somewhere in Scotland, the morning after the formal announcement, and having followed this last week’s proceedings at a significant distance, the sensation is heightened of having watched a scripted drama take place. It is as though the Labour Party put on a play and the rest of the country had no choice but to watch right through to the end in full knowledge, as with Julius Caesar learned by rote at school, of what that end would be. We watched for the entertainment and because we were forced into the theatre stalls. It’s just a shame the acting was so terrible.\\nMost commentators would be in a bit of a fix this Sunday, or at least those who are worth their salt and took the election for granted as a piece of theatre with a scripted ending, and Muscat’s election as the inevitable conclusion. I look back and wonder what it was all for – going through the motions for the sheer hell of it. All the things we should be writing now that Labour has a new leader we have written already, several times over, since Alfred Sant announced his irrevocable resignation only to pop up again like the presumably slain (but not) ghoul in a video nasty. Because we have taken it for granted that Joseph Muscat would be the new leader, there is no sense of something new now. The Labour Party’s spontaneous mass rally, Jason Micallef’s wild grin and all the rest seem false. They knew victory was theirs from day one.\\nThe only surprise in this theatrical script is that George Abela gave the little toe-curler a bit of a run for his money. The man who started off as a no-hoper, exiled from the party for a decade, ended up with the second largest number of votes, beating three others by far who had had a considerable advantage over him in party terms. Joseph Muscat got the support of 574 party delegates, while Abela polled 291 votes, or roughly half as many. The interesting thing is that in the first round of voting, on Thursday evening, Abela got half as many votes as Muscat too, but then during the Friday round of voting, not enough of those who had voted for Coleiro, Falzon and Bartolo transferred their votes to him, opting for Muscat instead.\\nI was and still am, fortuitously, far removed from the spectacle of the teacher’s pet giving new meaning to the word cringe-making on television, but I have been reliably informed that he was shown beaming with delight and that Jason has been doing a fair bit of strutting and fanning his tail. I predict that Muscat’s ‘smile’ – I really have to put it in inverted commas – will come to be his undoing. It is a fairly recent development in terms of his public appearances, and a very self-conscious one. In his television appearances of just a few years ago, he glowered at government politicians or was deadpan. Having become aware of the embedded failure in Sant’s inability to smile convincingly, and having realised how successful Gonzi’s real smile was while campaigning, Muscat has clearly decided to do a lot of smiling of his own. The trouble is that it is as unconvincing as Sant’s rare fleeting facial cracks. Not only does it not reach his eyes – something that the emotionally intelligent are able to pick up instantly if only subconsciously – but when it does reach his eyes (a true smile) it is one of self-satisfaction and as such, it is repellent rather than attractive. There are a lot of people already who are overcome by the urge to slap that self-satisfied face they see on the television. Just imagine what it is going to be like a couple of years down the line if he carries on in this way, especially with Jason on his arm like a bride.\\nThe ability of the Labour Party to choose inappropriate leaders has by now become a given. Just look at its track record of Dom Mintoff, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, Alfred Sant and Joseph Muscat. Muscat is in the same mould insofar as that he provokes polarised reactions in people: party die-hards think that the sun shines out of the seat of his trousers, while everyone else is hugely put off. The difference between Muscat and the other three is that the other three – well, not quite KMB who was slotted in to fill the gap – were brought to power initially on a wave of high hopes and great enthusiasm. Muscat, on the other hand, has been met with heightened cynicism and dislike even before his election. He is Alfred Sant’s anointed one and the main protagonist of Sant’s latest piece of theatre, and so this was inevitable. Muscat is going to find it difficult, if not impossible, to persuade us away from the conviction that the main reason he is leader of the party today is because he stapled himself to Sant’s trouser-hem.\\nI think you will find, and this is just a gut reaction and not the result of any intricate survey, that support for Joseph Muscat is to be found only among those who look up to him. You might say that this is obvious, but it is not. We don’t necessarily look up to the politicians we support. We might admire them, yes, but not look up to them. With Joseph Muscat, there’s something else at work, which would account for the manner in which he is a party favourite while at the same time repelling great swathes of people. An analysis of his support base would probably indicate that it comes from people who see him as superior in some way, and themselves as lesser beings than he is. They are impressed – as with Alfred Sant before him – by the dog-that-walks-on-its-hind-legs factor. Here is the Labour boy who actually became a ‘doctor’ (and not one of medicine, which is even more impressive, apparently), who sallied forth from our shores and made good on foreign soil, taking on the foreigners on their own ground – one of several hundred MEPs but a hero to those who don’t know what the European Parliament is like, and that in the main it is stuffed full of political nonentities. The interesting thing is that there is a flipside to this business of being looked up to, and it is being looked down upon by those who aren’t impressed by something they consider ordinary rather than extraordinary, and who are looking for other qualities in a leader, qualities that they can’t see in Joseph Muscat. Strangely, I have heard several people comment that he strikes them as immature. I see him that way too, but I can’t quite put my finger on why, given that he is a married man with children, in his mid-30s, with an academic and political track record. Yet he comes across as childish and shallow, like a cocky and inept teenager inside a man’s body.\\nThe years ahead will be amusing ones, at any rate, even if they will be disturbing at times. I am curious to see how the Gonzi/Muscat dynamic develops. I am struck – negatively, it goes without saying – by Muscat’s statement a few days ago that he will finish writing a report for the European Commission, which should take until September, before he takes on his duties as leader of the party, which demonstrates his order of priorities. We shall see how he develops as party leader, and whether he achieves the required stature and maturity, or remains a poodle promoted beyond his ability. I can tell you this at the outset: I am going to find it impossible to take him seriously. Five years ago he was doing Charlon Gouder’s job in Charlon Gouder’s style, and now I am expected not to greet with great hilarity and raised eyebrows the fact that he is party leader and might very well be prime minister. Oh well, that’s Malta for you – a bit of a joke.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nThis photograph is perfect. It captures the very essence of what is wrong – ridiculous, actually – about Joseph Muscat as leader of the Labour Party. He can’t be taken seriously, and this picture says it all. It is my favourite.\\nI’ve just shown it to my colleague, who takes absolutely no interest in politics and never reads the newspapers. But sometimes people like this are the most perceptive, because they have no preconceptions and are not conditioned into holding one opinion or another. “He’s doing it for fun,” she said. “It’s obvious.”\\nThat’s what I think, too – even though I am very interested in politics and always read the newspapers. I think that Joseph Muscat is on a joy-ride. I think he’s in it for the kicks and the thrills, and not because he’s a man with a mission to change the country for the better.

Ah, but he’s keeping his seat in parliament, so now the government has a two-seat majority over the opposition, and one independent MP sits in the middle.\\nIt’s kind of funny, given that the Labour Party tried so hard to bully one of the MPs on the government side into resigning from the party (though they ‘cunningly’ never said anything about resigning from parliament).\\nJoe Debono Grech’s resignation from the Labour Party is a good thing for the party, not a bad one, in the long run. I just find it amusing that the first person to throw down the gauntlet in so public a fashion is the very one whom Mr Yap-Yap described as his mentor in a newspaper article.\\n  \\n\\n\\nJoseph Muscat and Alfred Sant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, June 9th, 2008 at 12:27 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nDon’t wait for the opinion polls, honey….just ask Daphne. Three days into the leadership of Joseph! Joseph! and I can pick up already that this is the profile of the person (from outside the traditional Labour fold) who is favourably predisposed towards him:\\n\\nmale\\n30s-40s\\nnever married/separated/cohabiting/single\\nchildless or ‘detached’ from his children; either way, not a family man\\nthinks of himself as liberal and ‘special’\\nhas an impractical approach to politics, i.e. politics is not the art of the possible, but of ‘what should be’\\nsupported AD in the last election campaign, though might have pulled out of voting for the party at the 11th hour\\nis attracted to Joseph! Joseph! for precisely the same reasons he was attracted to AD (not necessarily the policies)\\n\\nChange category (1) to female, keep the rest intact, and you’ll have somebody who is not favourably predisposed to Joseph! Joseph!\\nYou read this here first, too: Joseph Muscat is not attractive to women unless they are the traditional diehard sort, who would root for a Martian if he were MLP leader. Women really don’t like Joseph Muscat. The reason, I suspect, is that we tend to use our in-built mating ‘search and destroy’ radar when analysing any man in any situation. Our brain, consciously or subconsciously, asks this question: would I pick him for a mate? With most women, the analysis is made instantaneously, our brain amassing and assessing in a nano-second a whole raft of visual and other clues. The most important of these clues, and this reflects the biological programming, is trust. When a woman assesses a man, any man in any situation, the first thing she registers is not his physical appearance but whether she can trust him or not. Sometimes it’s conscious, sometimes it’s subconscious. If the message she picks up is ‘not sure/unreliable/not trustworthy’ she doesn’t even bother checking out the other details.\\nWomen see Joseph! Joseph! on the stage, on television, prancing and prating and preening and grinning, and we assess him in exactly the same way as we would if we saw him, as a non-politician, in a bar or at a party. The alarm bells go off, and one word, beginning with ‘w’ and ending in ‘r’, passes through our mind. We know that it is only a matter of time before he comes up to us with a self-assured grin and a swagger, holds out his hand, and saya ‘Hi, call me Joseph! Come here often?’ Then he’ll spend the next 30 minutes bending our ear about his car/job/new watch/skiing trip until we excuse ourselves to go to the lavatory.\\nIncidentally, the mating ‘clue-reading’ that is hard-wired into the female brain (though there are some unfortunate exceptions) is also the reason why so many of the ladies ran after Gonzi with their vote and stuck his picture to their fridge. The hard-wiring was screaming out ‘Good mate! Good mate! You can trust this guy! You can marry him! He’s not a cheat!’\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJoseph! Joseph! may impress the party delegates by saying that he has an important report to finish for the European Commission before he can turn his attention to the party he now leads, but I think he’s utterly absurd for doing it. Here he is, in Malta Today last Sunday.\\nAsked about when he will resign his post in the European Parliament, Muscat said: “I need to conclude a report about VAT and financial services for which I have a deadline from the European Commission. When I conclude this job, I will resign from the European parliament and take my place in the Maltese parliament. I do not see it happening later than next September.\\nWhy has every single reporter who picked up on this failed to challenge him about it? It seems to have been accepted as normal that the leader of Malta’s opposition party should put his party responsibilities and his duty to his own country on hold while he finishes a report about financial services for the European Commission, when he could very well hand over the job to somebody else, given the exceptional circumstances.\\nThe inexperienced fool is effectively saying that Malta and the Labour Party can wait while he finishes a job for somebody and something more important.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nBefore I begin: will all clever-clogs out there please desist from telling me to dot and cross letters? I know exactly where and how they should be dotted and crossed; I just can’t be fagged to fool around with the fonts. I also happen to believe that the person who came up with this dotting and crossing should have been stood against a wall and shot. If a human-being is capable of distinguishing between the different pronunciations of though, through and trough, then a human being is capable of picking up the fact that the ‘z’ in ‘zwieg’ is pronounced differently to the ‘z’ in ‘ziju’. And as for the dot on the ‘c’, when there is no equivalent without a dot……shoot the guy twice.\\nBut back to Joseph! Joseph! He is ready to meet the prime minister (steady on, chap – you can’t do that until you’re opposition leader) for formal discussions on a great variety of issues, but he demands that he be treated as an equal because the party he leads represents half the population and so “should be treated with respect”.\\nHe can’t seem able to grasp the fact that elections are zero sum games: you win the government, or you lose the government. And when you lose, you don’t get to be treated like the government, because you’re not the government.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nNow maybe some bright geneticist can answer the question that rings in the ears of Maltese women: why do Maltese men have disproportionately short legs? This is not about being short in general, but about the legs being too short for the body, whatever the man’s height. This leaves you with the impression, when suits are worn, of a jacket hovering at a strangely short distance from the shoes, causing you to wonder where the knees are – as, infamously, with Alfred Sant and now with Joseph! Joseph! And for God’s sake, chaps – there are tailors about, you know. There’s a very good one called Constantino in Sliema Road, Gzira, opposite Azzopardi’s fish shop. You take your trousers there, and you say the magic words ‘Please shorten these’ and then a week later, you pick them up. I just CAN’T STAND that ‘long curtains bunched up on the floor’ look. It’s like holding up a placard that says ‘My legs are too short for these trousers.’ Or, let’s be positive: ‘These trousers are too long for my legs.’\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nHere’s the famous video-clip of Joseph! Joseph! singing the Innu Malti with his hand on his heart, his eyes closed, a scintillating tie, and Lil Din (as he referred to his wife) at his side. Fabulous.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nI bet Lawrence Gonzi’s relieved that at last there’s a Labour Party leader who actually talks instead of behaving like a walking, talking jacket with a Miss Whiplash complex. But I imagine he’s disappointed that it’s somebody he can’t relate to as an equal. I can’t help thinking he must feel a little insulted that Labour sent the junior staff along to the meeting. But there are compensations, not least of which was the opportunity to juxtapose real charm and ease against the self-consciously manufactured variety. And Gonzi must have been thrilled to see that Muscat brought his little friend Jason along with him on a day when the cameras were out in force.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, June 10th, 2008 at 9:17 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere was mass hysteria and euphoria in the aisles as Dr Joseph Muscat took on Dr John Bonnici Mallia in a faint-for-Jesus face-off in Hamrun last Sunday.

The report blames Harry Vassallo’s failure to sort out his VAT problems, the promotion of the idea of a coalition, over-confidence rooted in the MEP election result for Arnold Cassola, the Nationalist Party for stealing its green cloak, the party’s neglect of social issues, and its failure to communicate with people ‘in the south’ while “adopting a strategy focussed on the north”.\\nAnd who sat on the committee and wrote the report? Carmel Cacopardo of AD, Claire Bonello of AD and Kurt Sansone of AD. Cacopardo stood for election under the AD ticket and contributed to the mess with his ‘whistleblower’ antics. Claire Bonello wrote one newspaper column after another justifying the agitation for a coalition and denying that the party was targeting voters in traditional PN strongholds while ignoring the Labour strongholds of ‘the south’. And Kurt Sansone is one of the disproportionate number of AD-voting reporters at the Malta Today/Illum stable, who I predict will now start swinging from Joseph Muscat’s tail because he is just the kind who will appeal to them.\\nYou don’t have to be crazy to work at AD, but apparently, it helps.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWatching Joseph Muscat on Dissett last night, I couldn’t help noticing that he had strict instructions to keep his facial expression serious and steady. Only the night before, on Bondi+, he was grinning like a lunatic. I’ve cast my mind over both shows in a vain attempt at trying to remember something worthwhile that he might have said, but I can’t. My notes don’t say much, either. I sat there with my pen and notebook, ready to jot down details of his projected earthquake and vision, and was left with just a few words on an otherwise empty page. Here they are:\\n\\nThe man who has lived and worked in a French-speaking environment for four years can’t pronounce ‘malaise.’ Somebody should tell him that Malays are people from Malaysia, and that “a Malays” is not something that you can provoke in your colleagues by getting an endorsement from a German politician who spent years running a bookshop before deciding to become a councillor.\\nThe man who was against VAT because Alfred told him it was bad and naughty and that it would help them win the 1996 election is now putting his party leadership responsibilities on hold so that he can write a report on VAT for the European Commission, in which he claimed, because Alfred told him so, that Malta would never have a voice.\\nThe victory film-clips showed him to be backed by a cabal of Sant’s ghouls, and embracing the ghastly Manwel Cuschieri of Radju Super One, whose brother Joe’s parliamentary seat he will be taking, leaving him in the political debt of the Cuschieri brothers.\\nThe apology he made for Labour’s hideous past in the 1970s and 1980s was fatuous, facile, unfelt and unmeaning, and passed by unnoticed and unremarked upon, except by me here and now. He praised Mintoff to high heavens and then in the next breath apologised for Labour’s ‘mistakes’, all of which were caused by the man whose bottom he had just licked.\\nHe seems to think that it doesn’t matter if you take the wrong decision, however grievous the consequences, as long as you say sorry. His views on EU membership? He was mistaken, and he has no trouble admitting it. What he doesn’t seem to realise is that if he had achieved his aim of keeping Malta out of the EU, the consequences would have been catastrophic for this country and its people. A facile ‘I made a mistake’ is insulting to us because he could have ruined our lives.\\nWhen Lou Bondi pointed out to him that George Abela had been prevented by Sant from standing for the MEP election under the Labour ticket, Joseph Muscat said that Sant hadn’t wanted him to stand either. Lou wanted to know why, in that case, Sant hadn’t prevented him from standing under the Labour ticket, and the Ginger Frog (apologies to all ginger people, but I couldn’t resist that) said: “Sfidajtu!” Oh yes, I’m sure. If that’s really the case, then we have to ask what sort of relationship those two had. No one can defy the party leader and stand for election under the party ticket, because to stand under the party ticket, you need the express permission of the party leader. Sfidajtu my eye. Excuse my language, but what an a**hole.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLike his predecessors Sant and Mintoff, Joseph Muscat is going to be one of those Labour leaders who feels intellectually superior to his followers, and who gives in to the urge to patronise them with fables, parables and pedagogic speeches delivered with the rhythm of a primary school teacher from the 1930s. For God’s sake, how do Labour supporters and delegates tolerate this insulting treatment?\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nFigures released today by the National Obstetric Information System show that one in every three babies (33%) born here is delivered by Caesarean section, either elective (which means it is done even when it is not necessary, or just in case) or emergency (which means that the baby, the mother or both would be in serious trouble otherwise). This appears to me to be a disproportionately high number. Are there any doctors out there who can comment? Meanwhile, I found this UK press release which details the situation in Britain, where a one-in-four incidence of Caesarean section in 2005 was considered cause for concern and for analysis by the health authorities. Caesareans are hugely more expensive than normal deliveries, which means greatly increased profit for the private hospitals and clinics, but spiralling costs for the state health care service, as pointed out in these facts and figures from Britain. As in Britain, the escalating number of Caesarean sections may be linked to the fact that increasing numbers of Maltese women are now having their first babies in their 30s. The link between Caesareans and what the medics call an ‘elderly primagravida’ is made in the UK press release, too – but there, the elderly first-time pregnancies are in women in their 40s and not just their 30s. I had noticed that lots of women I know who gave birth in their 30s were given a C-section almost as a matter of course, and I did remember thinking that it can’t possibly be that all of these were incapable of giving birth normally. Women gave birth in their 30s in the 1970s and 1980s, too, after all, and Caesarean sections were really exceptional. Women weren’t stronger then; they’re probably much stronger now. So what exactly is happening?\\nRising UK birth rates and causes of increasing numbers of caesarean deliveries – Office of Health Economics / 2007\\n  \\n\\n\\nRising UK birth rates and causes of increasing numbers of caesarean deliveries\\n\\n  \\nHarry Vassallo has resigned and Arnold Cassola has stepped into the chairmanship of Alternattiva Demokratika. That should pull in the youth vote, especially if he keeps turning up to events dressed like somebody’s elderly bachelor uncle who’s off fishing. Why don’t they just call it a day?\\nI wonder what Harry’s going to do now.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJoseph Muscat has bothered to inform us that in two weeks time he will take a break from writing his VAT report for the European Commission to announce his shadow cabinet. He intends, he said, to have lots and lots of spokesmen for everything under the sun, including stuff which isn’t covered by the ministerial portfolios that these so-called shadow ministers are supposed to shadow.\\nMuscat demonstrates that he doesn’t know the difference between a shadow minister and an Opposition party spokesman on, say, the economy. Under Alfred Sant, Malta had no shadow cabinet because Sant too insisted on legions of spokesmen rather than actual shadow ministers. The result was chaos, with the electorate unable to make head or tail of Labour’s position. Now under Muscat there will again be no shadow cabinet – and please would The Times learn the difference? – because he is going to appoint an army of spokesmen instead (and call it shadow cabinet).\\nMaking all or most of his MPs spokesmen means a total lack of transparency, because the electorate will not be able to see who will form Muscat’s actual cabinet if and when he becomes prime minister, and so the electorate will be asked to vote blindly for an unknown quantity. The Times and everyone else has missed this and swallowed Muscat’s spin – or rather, his uninformed comment, because I actually believe that not even he knows the difference.\\nSo, for the benefit of The Times and of Malta’s future prime minister: a shadow cabinet is a parliamentary structure in which the leader of the Opposition is the shadow prime minister. It is not a gathering of mouthpieces who have been delegated to talk to the press about this subject or that one. Reno Bugeja brought up the matter briefly on Dissett, but too briefly and he allowed Muscat to gloss over it.\\nMuscat said that he can afford to have 30 ‘shadow ministers’ because he doesn’t have to pay them. Those aren’t shadow ministers. Those are spokesmen. A shadow minister is the person who will actually be the minister in charge of that particular portfolio if and when you become prime minister.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nFunny what a lot of misconceptions there are about the so-called honeymoon period. Some people appear to believe that it is mandatory, a 100-day period in which we should lay off new party leaders and prime ministers to ‘give them a chance’. It is at times like this that I wonder in despair at the insular bubble in which so many of my compatriots appear to live. Where on earth do they get these ideas from?\\nThe 100-day period is a piece of psychology. During those first 100 days, it is assumed that the electorate is favourably disposed towards the new incumbent and so more tolerant. After the 100 days are up, the electorate’s tolerance threshold is supposed to fall dramatically. If, on the other hand, the electorate can’t stand the sight and sound of the new incumbent to begin with, then the electorate is free to say what it thinks from day one, and well it should do.\\nThose 100 days are a self-imposed armistice only for the two warring parties involved, and it’s got nothing to do with goodwill or honeymoons. They do it so as to appear marginally civilised and not come across badly with the electorate. In actual terms, it means nothing, and only the naïve believe that we’re going to have a political love-fest for the next five years, until we come to the general election and Lawrence Gonzi says, “Oh do go ahead, Joseph. It’s your turn to be prime minister now. I’ll just sit here in the shade and take a break. I’m sure you’ll do a lovely job.”\\nThere is going to be as much cooperation and goodwill between Gonzi and Muscat as there is between two women who are after the same man, two kids who are after the same toy and two men who are after the same job. Joseph Muscat wants Lawrence Gonzi’s job and will do all he can to get it. Lawrence Gonzi doesn’t want Joseph Muscat to get his job and will do all he can to stop him. Is that a recipe for cooperation? Well, hardly. Beneath the thin veneer of civilisation and formal good manners, they’re both working out how best to stick the knife in. I wouldn’t expect anything less, because it would mean that they’re political wimps who aren’t up to the task. You don’t cooperate with the person who wants what you’ve got. That would be insane. Instead, you pretend to cooperate.\\nThe newspapers carried a photograph of Muscat and Gonzi sitting side by side on a sofa at the Nationalist Party headquarters. Some people are very excited about this. They think it heralds a new political era. Because Muscat said that he plans to cooperate with the government, instead of behaving like his dog-in-the-manger predecessor, the Polly-Annas in our midst imagine that the prime minister will be giving Muscat one of the spare rooms at the Auberge de Castille and calling him up for advice three times a day. Some people only hear what they want to hear, and see only what they want to see, and so they missed the qualifier in Muscat’s sentence: “as long as the government treats us like an equal partner, because we represent half the electorate.”\\nIn other words, Joseph Muscat wants to share the premiership with Lawrence Gonzi, and is aiming for a kind of government-by-committee made up of representatives of both parties. The man is even sillier than I had thought. If we’re going to have government by committee, why have elections at all? As Gonzi reminded him, the people chose a Nationalist government, not a Labour government nor a coalition. Allowing the opposition to set the agenda or hijack it, under the guise of cooperation, would be an insult to the electorate who made it quite clear that they did not want Labour in government.\\nThe headless chickens over at the Labour Party are thrilled with their new leader, even though his first public acts were to patronise them with a parable about his life, talk down to them as though they are peasants and his intellectual inferiors (something that Sant did all the time), and explain to them the meaning of the Labour anthem’s lyrics. Oh yes, and he referred to his wife uncouthly, while holding a microphone and speaking from a stage to hundreds of people, as ‘lil din’ (this one), instead of ‘my wife, Michelle’. These headless chickens, elves and poodle-fanciers are out in force in cyberspace now, defending their insane choice of party leader, and telling the rest of us that we’re jealous because he’s so smart, young, clever and handsome (yes, really).\\nThen there’s another category of people, those who say that we should give Muscat a chance because he’s in his honeymoon period. Yes, I know that he sometimes reads like an essay in self-love, but I didn’t know you could marry yourself in a country where a man who’s become a woman has been told that she can’t marry anyone at all because she’s a neither a man nor a woman.\\nI’d like to ask these people at which point exactly they decided that Joseph Muscat is new. Joseph Muscat is anything but new. His wife Michelle has just given an interview to KullHadd describing how when she met him in 1995, he was already a prominent figure in the Labour Party, a journalist she listened to eagerly on Super One. Then she married her hero. He has beavered away in the Labour Party since 1992. He was one of Super One’s first recruits. For at least 15 years he has been in the public eye, one of the Labour Party’s most visible faces because of his constant exposure on Super One radio, Super One television, the party’s so-called news portal Maltastar.com, and in Labour-leaning and Labour-owned newspapers, where he wrote article after article telling us that VAT is bad (and now he’s writing a report about it for the European Commission), that EU membership would mean suicide for Malta, and that we should spoil our vote, vote No or not vote in the membership referendum. And then after the referendum he told us that he had done as Sant did and not voted. As a key figure in the Labour Party’s attack-team, he played a far greater part in attempting to sabotage Malta’s membership of the EU than many Labour politicians. It is thanks to the efforts of those on the other side of the trenches, myself included, that Joseph Muscat is where he is today. He should be crawling about on his hands and knees and grovelling his thanks, because without us he’d still be Charlon Gouder.\\nThose who wish to pretend to themselves that Joseph Muscat was born on June 6, 2008 are free to drown themselves in a sea of self-delusion. They shouldn’t expect the rest of us to follow them over the cliff-edge like lemmings. Muscat is on the cusp of middle age. People don’t go through major personality shifts or drastic character changes in their mid-30s. I think the psychiatrists would say that this is impossible. By that age, much earlier in fact, you are what you are going to be until the day you die. If you want to give Muscat a chance, at least have the self-respect to frame your opinion in the context of his 16-year track record in the public eye. That way, when he smugly tells Reno Bugeja on Dissett, as he did a couple of nights ago, that he telephoned the president to wish him well, you will remember, as I immediately did, the television footage of him only five years ago, shouting at Fenech Adami, who was his prime minister at the time, like a monti hawker, insulting him, disparaging him, and accusing him of condemning Malta to death with his ‘obsession’ with the EU. It was one of those fabulous vote-haemorrhaging television moments. I can just imagine how thrilled the president was to receive that telephone call, given that he probably views Muscat with as much contempt as I do, and for roughly the same reasons.\\nIf you bothered with his track record, instead of insisting that he’s new and should be given a chance, you would also be able to put into context Muscat’s absurd pronouncements on ethics in the political media. There speaks the man who set up the appalling Maltastar.com, who hugs Manwel Cuschieri in public while negotiating for his brother’s seat in parliament, who was the Charlon Gouder of the 2003 election, and who was a Super One ‘journalist’ – the commas are essential – for several years. He is also the very same Sant acolyte who wrote a book about ‘corruption’, published in the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti, which contained so many hideous lies and slandered so many people that he was sued for libel by those he had written about for no reason other than that his party saw them as enemies. I know because I was one of them. He inserted my name and a large colour picture into a fantastical and complicated piece of fiction that drew in the P2, the Mafia, the Bologna train station bombing, the Kennedy assassination the year before I was born, Roberto Memmo and Chambray, and God knows what else. I sued both him and his party bosses and won a significant sum. The only thing I can say in his favour is that he paid up immediately, while I had to chase Jason for weeks and ended up slapping a garnishee order on all the Labour Party’s bank accounts, only to be told there wasn’t any money in a single one of them. I only got my cheque when I threatened to send the bailiffs for Sant’s desk and computer.\\nSorry, but I can’t take Joseph Muscat seriously. That’s because I’m a fairly intelligent 43-year-old woman who knows that 34-year-old men don’t change. What they are is what they will remain. Muscat will only survive the next five years and become prime minister if he can keep up the bluffing with enough people not noticing just how far short of the mark he is.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nHere’s the sentence handed down by the court on 8 April 2002 in the case Daphne Caruana Galizia v.

Joseph Muscat u l-Malta Labour Party sive Partit Laburista\\n\\n  \\nLabour delegates voted to fill the positions of deputy leader/parliamentary affairs and deputy leader/party affairs (they need two deputies because one can’t cope) and guess who got the most votes? Anglu ‘I went to India and I all got was a lousy elephant’ Farrugia for the one post, and Toni ‘Otello’ Abela for the other. Neither one got 50+ of the vote, so there are going to be a couple of run-offs today: between Anglu Farrugia and Chris Cardona on the one hand, and between Toni Abela and Gavin Gulia on the other.\\nJust to give you a morbid idea of who is most likely to win, these were the results in the first round:\\nDeputy leader/parliamentary affairs: Anglu Farrugia 409 votes and Chris Cardona 245 votes\\nDeputy leader/party affairs: Toni Abela 390 votes and Gavin Gulia 295 votes\\nIt looks like the new Labour leadership line-up is going to be Joseph Muscat, Anglu Farrugia and Toni Abela. And no, Labour elves, I swear that the Nationalist Party had nothing to do with it (as far as I know).\\nThe fresh, young and new Labour leadership line-up: L-Ispettur Farrugia, Joseph tas-Super One and Otello (minus the lady friend)\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe Labour Party could have had a leadership line-up of George Abela, Gavin Gulia and Chris Cardona. And instead, the delegates chose Joseph Muscat, Anglu Farrugia and Toni Abela.\\nWhat does that tell us? That was a rhetorical question.\\nJust as the leader was pre-selected, make no mistake that the deputy leaders were too. Muscat wants deputies with whom he can play around and not deputies who will challenge him, so that they are there for appearance’s sake only (and what an appearance).\\nIn this, he is following the model laid down by Sant, who after an initial experiment with a credible deputy leader called George Abela, decided that he was better off without deputy leaders who challenged his plans, and opted for Michael Falzon and Charles Mangion instead. As Michael himself has told us, he was left out of the loop completely, even during the crucial period of the general election. And Charles Mangion is still accommodating the Sant/Muscat combo, isodd it-toqob as the acting leader and now, as the temporary leader of the opposition.\\nMuscat is following the Sant pattern, too, in appointing a regiment of spokesmen instead of a tight shadow cabinet, which is what he should do. A tight shadow cabinet exposes him to the risk of being challenged by colleagues who achieve powerful status. By spreading that power to the point of negligibility over as many people as possible, he remains in sole control and with no one to challenge him.\\nI really need to know why Labour seems to crave the leadership of power-hungry megalomaniacs attended by two stooges.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOscar Wilde is supposed to have told US customs officers on entering New York that he had nothing to declare but his genius. Joseph Muscat has nothing to declare, full stop. Check this out (thank you, Mike).\\n  \\n\\n\\nJoseph Muscat: Nothing to declare but his wit\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Hey! Who are you calling Dumbo? That man on my back is the deputy leader of the Malta Labour Party. Call him Dumbo again and he’ll sue” – Ellie the Elephant\\nYou have to hand it to Labour. The party really knows how to keep the country in stitches. The election of the twin jokers in the pack of deputy leadership candidates has been met with great hilarity. Even Labour MPs are laughing, though in despair.\\nThe real surprise is that nearly half the population doesn’t get the joke and heads right out to vote for this ship of fools every five years in the hope that things will get better within the party. Five decades later, they’re still looking for reasons to give Labour a chance. Clearly, the relationship between the Labour Party and its electors constitutes a form of marriage without divorce. I wonder whether they even take the trouble to ask themselves why Labour will have won just three general elections in more than half a century by the time we get to the next round in 2013.\\nYes, that’s right: three elections in half a century since the start of the 1960s: 1971, 1976 and 1996. Because we’re talking in terms of popular support, and not seats in parliament, 1981 counts as another loss. And the 1996 win has to be framed in the context of just how many thousands of electors rushed to the polls to undo their decision only 22 months after making it. They gave Labour a chance and boy, did they regret it.\\nNo wonder people are so reluctant to say they vote Labour, in surveys or in conversation. They know it’s embarrassing, so when they do speak up, it’s with that air of defiance, like a teenage announcing he’s gay at a family lunch with all the grandparents present and correct. Someone sticks up for Labour and everyone else raises an eyebrow and thinks of a new subject to take the conversation in a different direction as rapidly as possible. To say you vote Labour in polite company nowadays is like announcing that you have genital warts. Others change the subject to avoid the possibility of unpleasantness and too much information.\\nWhenever an otherwise sensible person is brave enough to claim that he or she votes Labour – anywhere other than on the comments-board of a blog or newspaper forum, that is – I immediately assume that this person’s views have been shaped by the family, in which case they might just perhaps be excused for failing to think more rationally later on in life. If the person doesn’t come from a Labour family, then I wonder what caused the shoulder-chips to grow. It has been my observation that when somebody who is fairly intelligent, from a non-Labour background and without working-class roots suddenly embraces the Labour Party in its incarnation of the past 50-odd years, something has gone wrong in that person’s life.\\nDeciding to support the risible Labour Party becomes an act of defiance against the gods and society, a reverse salute at life itself, and is the fruit of bitterness and disappointment, perhaps even of anger and envy. Angry teenagers dress like Goths and smash telephone booths. Angry grown-ups vote for Labour and the three stooges.\\n\\nDespite the word going round that the party machine promoted Chris Cardona and Gavin Gulia, others who share my political sympathies were pretty confident that former policeman Anglu Farrugia and Super One’s Otello Toni Abela would be elected. At a meeting on Thursday afternoon, before the first electoral round, somebody brought this up, and my reaction was that Labour delegates may have hopeless taste and no political nous, but they’re not actually certifiably insane. Besides, wasn’t the party machine that pushed Joseph Muscat now supposed to be pushing Cardona and Gulia? It turns out I was wrong and my colleague was right.\\nWhen the result of the first round was made public at about midnight, L-Ispettur and Otello had so many more votes than the runners-up that the result of the Friday run-off was a foregone conclusion. My initial thoughts were that if they were so clearly the favourites of the party delegates, and by such a wide margin, then they and not Cardona and Gulia must have been the ones pushed by the Muscat machine. Perhaps Muscat felt more able to manipulate a couple of jokers like L-Ispettur and Otello. But I was left with some nagging doubts.\\nWhy would somebody who is trying so hard to come across as a smooth operator allow his lilo to be punctured by two deputy leaders that make the line-up look like the three stooges, when he could have had the more marketable and slicker outfit of Cardona and Gulia? Cardona and Gulia match Muscat. Abela and Farrugia match each other yet highlight Muscat’s posturing through contrast. It is the very recipe used by trios who perform comedy acts, but perhaps they’re not aware of it.\\nWhen I had thought about the matter some more, I realised that my initial analysis was completely wrong. There is no way that Muscat would have wanted Otello and L-Ispettur, and not just because they capsize his self-inflated image by behaving like an even more downmarket version of the Two Ronnies. An abiding image of the last electoral campaign is Toni Abela in some show that superseded Otello, wearing a pair of pilot’s gloves and doing a Godzilla impression around the Super One studio, muttering ‘par idejn sodi’, while the camera followed him around for the edification of the masses. Abela and Farrugia are going to be impossible to work with – the CEO’s worst nightmare of two directors voted in to represent the interests of family shareholders, who hijack and sabotage every meeting of the board by strenuously objecting to things they know nothing about, and making ludicrous suggestions while everyone else groans inwardly. Oh, and who then pounce on the tea and biscuits when they’re brought in.\\nJoseph Muscat must have wanted Cardona and Gulia, and L-Ispettur and Otello must have been the worst-case scenario for him. Now that worst-case scenario has materialised.\\nThe party machine which pushed Muscat so successfully stopped working efficiently after scoring that first goal, or else it met with great resistance. It’s important to remember that in the first electoral round – which is where the true loyalties of the delegates are to be identified – Muscat scored just under 50 per cent of the vote, and this despite the mammoth support he received through the power of incumbency of his backers. The delegates may have felt they had to vote as the incumbent powers wished them to vote, when it came to the party leader. But then when it came to voting for the deputy leaders, they revelled in the freedom to vote as their instincts told them to vote, and they homed in on the two most vulgar and rough-edged candidates in the line-up, and the ones most prone to making astonishing judgements (“The Nationalist Party won because it set up a fund to buy the votes of Labour drug addicts through agents.”). Seen in this light, the election of Anglu Farrugia and Toni Abela is beginning to look like a backlash against the perceived imposition of Joseph Muscat.\\n\\nAnglu Farrugia has announced that he has full faith in Joseph Muscat and wishes to help him cause an internal earthquake at the Labour Party, and another down the road at the Nationalist Party. That shouldn’t be a problem. All he has to do is fall on both buildings from a great height, preferably while sitting on an elephant.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent on Sunday today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nA friend messaged me last Thursday after reading my newspaper column, called ‘Give Joseph Muscat a chance? You must be joking.’ Her message said: ‘Good article, Daph, and quite refreshing after all the poppycock that has appeared in the newspapers.’\\nPoppycock – now that’s a word I haven’t heard in some time. But you know, she’s right (and yet another woman whose skin crawls at the sight and sound of Joseph Muscat). The newspapers have been awash with poppycock…and hogwash. Commentators of all political stripes have been lining up to say that come on, Joseph’s OK, he’s fresh and young, we should give him a chance, and the pig’s dinner he made of his election weekend speeches and anthem performances were just beginner’s errors. Come on. We think he’ll be good.\\nAt the age of 25 and the only newspaper columnist to mark Joseph Muscat down as a 34-year-old w***er who will develop into nothing more than a 54-year-old w***er, I might have doubted my judgment. At the age of 43, I most certainly do not. Nor do I have a short memory. In October 1996, everybody was mesmerized by Alfred Sant. The columnists and commentators were falling over themselves to lick his butt, and I was dismissed as the Wicked Witch of the West who publicly wrote him off as a weirdo who meant trouble. Ooooh, nasty. What a bitch. The proof of that particular pudding, as Sant and Muscat like to say, was in the eating.\\nThis afternoon, I sat down to read the newspapers after a festive lunch in celebration of the various fathers in the extended family. First I read The Malta Independent on Sunday, then Malta Today, and by the time I’d read halfway through The Sunday Times, I was wondering aloud whether the average Maltese male newspaper commentator is a repressed homosexual who fancies Joseph Muscat. There was almost a homoerotic undertow in much of what I read. Listen to the words that keep cropping up. Young. Fresh. Handsome. Attractive. Even ‘innocent’ was implied, in various suggestions that he is untainted by Old Labour. The only words missing here are ‘tight butt’ – which is just as well, given that he doesn’t have one despite that public display of early morning sweating at the gym on Xarabank. He appears to have a totally disarming effect on men, leaving even Lou Bondi momentarily nonplussed, Joe Azzopardi all loved up, and Reno Bugeja briefly lost for words.\\nRecently I wrote that Joseph Muscat flirts with men in exactly the same way that you would expect him to flirt with women (but I’ve never seen him interviewed by a woman or dealing with a woman politician in a more senior position than his). The more I think about it, the more I realise that this is his secret weapon, and the clue to why he makes a positive impact on (certain) men and a negative impact on women. Heterosexual men are not used to being engaged in flirtatious behaviour by other heterosexual men. If Joseph Muscat were a known homosexual, his behaviour would unnerve them. But because he is a known heterosexual, other heterosexual men feel ‘safe’ and respond positively to the flirtation.\\nWith women, it’s a whole different ball-game. Women respond negatively to ‘creepy’ flirtation because they get it all the time. Any confused men out there should ask their wives or girlfriends to explain the difference between creepy flirtation and the kind of flirtation we enjoy. Joseph Muscat’s communication style falls into the category of creepy flirtation.\\nTo all the male commentators (and one woman) in today’s newspapers, who seemed so keen to give Mr Gay Icon of the Year a sporting chance, his ill-judged performances of last weekend are there only to be overlooked or excused. To me, on the other hand, they are important signifiers as to his personality and character – very, very important signifiers. Just before I threw down The Sunday Times in exasperation and reached for The Sunday Telegraph, I came across the following article by the anthropologist Mark-Anthony Falzon. It’s absolutely brilliant, and it saved me from tearing my hair out.\\nWhen I enrolled in the university’s first anthropology programme around 15 years ago, Paul Sant Cassia told me that I would never see things in the same way again, and he was right. Unfortunately, it has led to moments of sheer and utter despair, like today, when I read reams of drivel by ‘political observers’ and find that no matter which side of the fence they’re sitting on, they still can’t see the obvious: that Joseph Muscat behaved like a total and complete w***er on the most important occasion of his life, and that a man who does that is going to demonstrate equally poor judgment at other crucial points along the way. After all, we are speaking here of a 30-year-old man with a postgraduate degree in European Studies who was totally and utterly convinced that EU membership would mean the ruination of Malta, and who had to become an MEP to understand the benefits that my 97-year-old grandmother grasped in a twinkling. Indeed, that same 97-year-old grandmother would watch Joseph Muscat on Made in Brussels and contradict him loudly with many a “Pooh, miskin, kemm ma jifhimx. Dawn tal-Labour dejjem vroma.”\\nBecause you really should read Mark-Anthony Falzon’s article, I’m reproducing it here and not just providing the link, in case you’re too lazy to click.\\nThe Sunday Times, 15 June\\nJoseph loves me\\nMark-Anthony Falzon\\nJust when you thought that ‘Smart Island’ and ‘Flimkien kollox possibli’ were the sugary pits, along came Joseph Muscat with an Oscar-acceptance-speech-meets-il-priedka-tat-tifel do. It’s not easy to impress with vacant rhetoric in a country where people phone a radio DJ to dedicate ‘No more lonely nights’ to their 80-year-old granny, but that’s exactly what Muscat pulled off.\\nGiven that he had at least three months to prepare his maiden speech, I really can’t understand how he managed to get it so wrong.\\nHaving mimed the Labour anthem, Muscat first told us he loves us. Now, what does a rational person do when a politician says “I love you”? Run a mile, of course.\\nPoliticians are expected to represent, not love, and it is normally only despots the likes of Kim Jong Il who have the gall to declare their amorous intent to ‘their’ people. In any case, if you must say those three words on camera, you’d better be Serge Gainsbourg, drunk, and addressing Jane Birkin – not Joe Grima in wrap-around sunglasses. If you insist on blowing kisses on top of that, there really is no redemption. There was more talk of love and brotherhood – he urged us to ‘love each other’, and to ‘love Michelle (his wife) as she loves us’.\\nAt this point I expected him to go urbi et orbi or speak in tongues, but he went on to tell us a story (how very sweet – and it didn’t sound at all rehearsed). It turned out to be about himself and his jaw-dropping achievements, which, he assured us, would not have been possible 50 years ago, or without the Labour Party.\\nQuite apart from the pathetic and dated socialist triumphalism of that (‘if it weren’t for the powerless the powerless would still be powerless’), its irony in the circumstances seemed lost on Muscat. After all, nasty people have been saying all along that he owes his success to the party. Ask George Abela, or Michael Falzon.\\nHe also quite forgot a certain Dom Mintoff, also originally very working class, who earned his laurels well over 50 years ago. Muscat did mention Mintoff actually, and told us that ‘no one will manage to take him away from our hearts’. (Does that include Alfred Sant?) His ‘little story’ also told of ‘early promise’ at school and of his inability to distinguish modern medicine from the Labour Party.\\nMuscat then proceeded to a series of gaffes which made Sant’s ‘Gonziii’ speech sound like vintage Churchill fare. He said, for example, that he intends to make Malta ‘the best in Europe’. Oh dear. The last time I heard someone say that Malta will be ‘at the apex’ of Europe, his name was Norman Lowell. Muscat also told us that Labour is ‘back in business, big time’. I suppose he, like his mentor, thinks that the word ‘business’ sounds modern, hardnosed, American, and inevitably successful (never mind that most businesses eventually fail).\\nThe surreal moment was reached when he invited lapsed Labourites to ‘return to their true home’, or else. He will go after them himself. Honest, he said that, which shows how ‘fresh’ and ‘progressive’ his political beliefs are. Just imagine, a knock at your door one summer evening and two plain clothes Labourites asking you, on behalf of Muscat, what you think you’re doing packing your barbecue rather than folding newsletters at Mile End. But then we’ve always known that lovers expect, as if by birthright, to be loved back.\\nAt the end of this bizarre performance, Muscat added two riders. The first: ‘Call me Joseph’ (What else? Caesar?); according to him the form ‘Honourable’ (as in an MP) is a ‘nickname’, which speaks volumes about his attitude to our highest institution. The second: ‘There’s no one behind Joseph’ – which must have caused Jason Micallef and the rest of the backdrop some existential pangs.\\nHis body language doesn’t help. The man is stiff as a starched collar, walks with a swagger, and really has no idea what to do with his hands. I’ve spent the last few days wondering what might have inspired his strange and stylised gestures, and I’ve shortlisted two sources: The first is the Augustus of Prima Porta, the second the vernacular statues in our churches.\\nLet’s be kind and not compare him to the first. The second only get away with it because they don’t grin at their own ‘wit’, as our man does. They’re also wisely hidden away in some obscure corner of the church for most of the year, unlike Muscat, whose antics look set to be plastered all over the place for many years to come.\\nMuscat puts his hand on his heart when the national anthem is played, just like Brazilian footballers. Actually, on Sunday, he put it slightly lower, on his tummy, and closed his eyes. The man either needs an anatomy lesson, or he was upset by his own rhetoric.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nJoseph Muscat continued his live performance in Jesus Christ Superstar yesterday with a sparkling rendition of I Don’t Know How to Love Them. He told The Sunday Times that he’s pleased with the party delegates’ choice of deputy leaders. And then, probably, he flashed his teeth – though that didn’t go down on the record.\\nMuscat insisted that L-Ispettur and Otello’s ‘political baggage’ won’t hinder his efforts at building ‘a winning team’. Well, if he builds this winning team it’ll be a bleeding miracle, given that since 1996 none of Labour’s myriad ‘winning teams’ have ever won anything – or even been a team, it transpires.\\nNow let’s hear what Muscat had to say about the weighty baggage of his two deputies, the moustachioed wonders from a bygone era.\\n“Everyone has baggage. What’s wrong with that? There is no politician who does not have political baggage. This is not a problem and I look forward to working with them, as I have already started to do.”\\nThere is no politician without political baggage? Spoken like a true greenhorn. Our friend with the tie-dye mind is just asking to have it pointed out to him that he should have put a little qualifier in there: there is no politician without political baggage in the Labour Party. In the Nationalist Party, there are plenty. Let’s limit ourselves to party leaders. Lawrence Gonzi has no political baggage, nor did Eddie Fenech Adami. Alfred Sant was crippled by the weight of his, and Joseph ‘Vote No to Europe’ Muscat feels it necessary to brush off the baggage of L-Ispettur and Otello because he has so much of his own.\\nBetween them, the baggage of Labour’s three stooges would sink a ship.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, June 16th, 2008 at 8:46 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Nationalist Party’s outgoing secretary-general has let it slip, in an interview with The Sunday Times yesterday, that it was ‘Call Me Joseph’ Muscat who inadvertently sabotaged the Labour Party’s plan to unleash a surprise attack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando in the last week of the electoral campaign.\\nAt the time, I was told that the Nationalist Party had got wind of this from a senior official of the Labour Party, but I never knew who that senior official was. I imagined it was somebody who had it in for Sant, and who was doing it deliberately. I am thrilled to discover that it was Joseph Muscat, and that it only happened because he couldn’t keep his big mouth shut, because this adds to my rapidly-growing collection of incidents that illustrate his poor judgement. Muscat didn’t go knocking on Joe Saliba’s door to tell him: “Hey, they’re going to attack Jeffrey.” No. Instead he did what all those World War II posters warned about: Careless Talk Costs Lives. Joseph Muscat shot his mouth off in company and helped his army lose the war. Let’s hear it from Joe Saliba:\\n“As a party, our work is also to understand Labour’s strategy….if possible we have to be two steps ahead. We analyse the speeches and actions of every Labour official. That made us realise Labour was going to start attacking Jeffrey….On a television programme, Muscat said that Labour would be releasing information to implicate a Nationalist Party candidate in corruption. A couple of days after that programme, in a private conversation, Muscat inadvertently continued giving hints to show that he was aware of Labour’s strategy, and we managed to identify the candidate they would be picking on.”\\nThat’s the trouble with men who are too clever by half and too pleased with themselves. They want to show off and impress you with how well-connected they are and how in the know. So the man who captains this new winning team made up of Anglu L-Ispettur, Toni Otello and Jason Micallef sat there mouthing off about all the inside information to which he was privy, and Mata Hari (probably yet another man he was trying to impress) sat there flirting and egging him on and taking mental notes to report back to the Nationalist Party’s strategy group.\\nAnd then the Labour Party was screwed and Alfred Sant ended up taking shelter in the Crosscraft set at PBS studios while calling for the police to remove the offending object.\\nYes, well – what do you expect of a man who mimes to the lyrics of the party anthem?\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWWII poster\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, June 16th, 2008 at 8:52 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Monday, June 16th, 2008 at 3:21 pm and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n“Oh Christ, now I’ve gone and lost the deputy leader of the Malta Labour Party. He must have slipped off somewhere between here and Sandeep Nair. I’ll just stir up the mud a little and see if he floats to the surface.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJoseph Muscat’s public relations machine has taken time out from promoting Pampers nappies in The Times and updated his entry on Wikipedia. Here’s what his people – or probably person, Alfred Sant’s former PR woman Lil Din – gave as his CV under the heading ‘Career’.\\nThe first part of his career involved being born and raised a Catholic between 1974 and 1992. Smart career move, Joseph – it always pays to be born if you want to get ahead in this world. As for being raised a Catholic…..we’ve either got yet another chest-thumper here, or he’s even more of an opportunist than I had thought.\\nI’m not going to buy dinner for the first person to point out the glaring omission in this CV. It’s the four-year gap between 2004 and the present, the gap between editing (that’s a joke) Maltastar.com and becoming leader of the Partit Laburista. Why doesn’t he want to tell the world that he’s a member of the European Parliament? Now, I will buy lunch for the first person to give me the correct answer to that one, because I don’t have it.\\n\\nCareer\\n\\n1974–1992: born and raised a Catholic.\\n1992–1996: journalist with Labour radio station, One Radio.\\n1996–1997: assistant head of news at One TV.\\n1997: EICC Executive\\n1997–1999: market intelligence manager\\n2000–2004: investment adviser\\n2001–2004: editor of Labour online newspaper, maltastar.com\\nIn the Labour Youth Forum:\\n\\nFinancial Secretary (1994–1997)\\nActing Chairperson (1997)\\n\\n\\nIn the Malta Labour Party:\\n\\n1994–2001: member of the National Executive\\n2001–2003: Education Secretary\\n2003: Chairman of the Annual General Conference November\\n1997–1998: Member of the National Commission for Fiscal Morality\\n2008 – : Leader of the Malta Labour Party\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJoseph Muscat’s decision not to come back to Malta before the summer recess of the European Parliament is causing unnecessary Constituional problems. Forget Brussels – Malta is where he should be now that he has been elected leader of a political party that is torn apart by problems.\\nWe know that he is an essay in self-love, but surely he is not trying to tell us that the European Parliament cannot function without him? In that case, he’s in luck. There will not be any plenary sessions of the European Parliament between 10 July and 1 September. The whole of bureaucratic Brussels shuts down for six weeks between the middle of July and the end of August. Nothing, but nothing, happens in August in Brussels, except summer sales of bikinis and cotton mini-skirts. So Joseph Muscat can come back home to Labour safe in the knowledge that the European Parliament will not collapse without him.\\nAh, but he has told us repeatedly that he will not return for now, and certainly not before September. Hmmmmm. He blames it on a report he’s writing. In the Internet age, can’t he write it at home with Lil Din and the twins? Maybe he needs to interview people. In that case, he’d better do it fast, because the entire Brussels bureaucracy vanishes for the whole of August, and Joseph Muscat will find himself wandering the hot streets of Brussels all alone, trying to interview people who are on holiday.\\nWell, it’s interesting to see that the only MEP left behind in Brussels for the entire month of August is going to be the newly appointed leader of Malta’s Labour Party.\\nSo what’s the real reason he won’t come back before September (if that)? I think one of our intrepid male journalists should have faced him down and asked him that question, instead of salivating like lovestruck teenagers sitting opposite Jessica Rabbit.\\n  \\n\""
