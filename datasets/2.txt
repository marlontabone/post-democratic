From time to time I like to upload this video so that those of my friends and others who fell for this scary fascist bollocks and ranted and raved in favour of the crock of corrupt shite performing in it and then voted for it and him can squirm with embarrassment in their seats It beats being ungracious in personThey wont be squirming with regret of course  ma tarax They were conned They were tricked They were fooled But theyre not idiots No of course they arent Except that anybody with some basic knowledge of political communication would have recognised this instantly as a classic textbook piece of fascist messaging Its modelled directly on the National Socialist Party messaging of 1930s Germany with the added benefits of the communications technology of 2013That rush of patriotic pride you get watching it The goosebumps Your spirits soaring with the music to a sense of great things The wonderful fuzzy feeling of togetherness through nationhood to beat the rest of EuropeWell exactly But when I saw this for the first time on television in the 2013 campaign the only emotion I felt was primeval fear triggered by subconscious association of the sounds and visuals with historic recordings of fascist meetings The images flooding my mind were of Hitlers 1930s crowdrousing meetings swastikas scary faceless mobs brainwashed with a single message It was marketed as a positive message a positive video but subliminally all I picked up was a sense of deep unadulterated evil This video was the moment when I fully understood with dawning dread that sickened me what was to comeAs things turned out my jangling antennae were not wrong Even now I cant watch it without thinking how frightening it is   Din LArt Helwa has just uploaded this photomontage on social media Please share it widely People need to know how bad it is how bad its going to be how abusive the situation isWho can forget what a fuss and a scandal Muscat and his crooks kicked up in Opposition when Joe Gasan Mark Gasan and George Fenech invited the then Finance Minister Tonio Fenech for a trip on Fenechs private plane to watch a football match in England He was wrong to go and to make matters worse Mark Gasan had actually invited the Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi originally  but Gonzi had politely refusedNow Muscat and his crooks in power have given Joe Gasan Mark Gasan and George Fenechs heirs he has since died a corrupt contract for a power station an even more corrupt contract to buy all the electricity they produce whether we need it or not and at a price favourable to them and are planning on allowing them to build massive skyscrapers in Sliema and MriehelAnd that is just the abuse and crookery we know about Who knows what else there might be beneath the slimy surface  Anglu Farrugia the Speaker of the House confirms by default that the Prime Minister bought his silence in an interview with The Malta IndependentThe issues we had will remain between us he told his interviewer Pierre PortelliFarrugia was kicked out of the Labour Partys deputy leader position only a few weeks before the 2013 general election Party leader Joseph Muscat said that it was because he had passed a remark about a magistrate and impugned the independence of the judiciary The real reason was that Farrugia had performed disastrously on a peakviewingtime political debate and Muscat wanted to replace him with switchermagnet Louis Grech an elderly MEP battling cancer who had an extensive network of contacts among socioeconomic group ABAnglu Farrugia reacted by giving a big interview to The Sunday Times alluding to preelectoral shady dealings with business operators on the fourth floor of the Labour Partys headquarters He then went silent causing people to wonder whether he had struck a deal with MuscatImmediately Muscat was elected Prime Minister he appointed Farrugia Speaker of the House And last year a few days after she completed the statutory requirement of seven years of law practice he made Farrugias daughter Caroline a magistrate Just past 30 Caroline Farrugias entire work experience consisted of helping her father in his law office When he became Speaker she was left alone and couldnt cope A solution was found Farrugia also fixed a job for her husband his soninlaw in the parliament library  The Christmas crib which the Malta government commissioned by direct order for display at St Peters in Rome cost €114900 in payments to the maker Manuel Grech The sum does not include the cost of travel and accommodation for the sizeable delegation which included Justice Minister Owen Bonnici and his girlfriend Janice Bartolo who went to the Vatican for the inaugurationThe direct order is listed in the Government Gazette as having been given in June see picture below but in this publicity video released by Parliamentary Secretary Justyne Caruana Grech says that he has been working on it since February  four months before the government issued the direct orderYou have to ask why the government of Malta spent so much money on a Christmas crib for the Vatican in the first place instead of putting one up in Valletta or just using the money to feed the homeless  which is after all the essential theme of the Christmas crib The answer is in the opening seconds of the video Frank Zammit who has had a lifelong career as John Dallis personal assistant and who switched to Labour when Dalli did calls him a Vaticanologist  which means a person obsessed with the VaticanThis is the basis of corruption of course using public funds to satisfy the personal interests hobbies or quirks or bank accounts of the people in power who then pass on the jobs to their cronies     David Thake is back on Radio 101 from Monday every weekday between 430pm and 6pm making the rushhour traffic good again Altogether now Malta Tagħna Lkollħi  This is Joanne Vella Cuschieri a failed Labour Party candidate in the last general election and a close friend of Owen Bonnici who had her made a magistrate He seems to like giving state positions to his lady friends whether they are a couple or notI saw her most recently at Charles Grech café in Valletta a couple of weeks ago in a huddle with fellow Labour magistrate Consuelo Scerri Herrera who plonked herself down with her back to me It cant have been later than noon  Id like to see them try  Watch this space  my report will be up later this morning including a letter from John Dalli then Minister for Economic Services instructing the Commissioner for Lands directly to hand the land over to Marsovin in perpetuity for an annual ground rent Nineteen years later Marsovin sold it to Vassallo Builders for €8 millionVassallo Builders never dealt with the government at any point but only with Marsovin John Dalli served as an unofficial consultant to Marsovin at various points over the years and was its chairman between 2004 and 2008 when he had been forced to resign from the cabinet of government over corruption accusations in the purchase of air tickets for his ministry from his daughters  for which read his  travel agency  I was listening to Norman Vella on Radio 101 while driving home yesterday and Zaren talAjkla rang in to hector him insult the Nationalist government of yesteryear quoting the Labour Partys propaganda and praise the Labour PartyImmediately another man rang in from Zejtun Isnt it obvious Zaren talAjkla is going to say that he said Hes one of Owen Bonnicis biggest supporters Owen Bonnici is his cousinThe thought of Owen talAjkla kept me amused all the way home  I had an email this morning from a friend who is sick to the back teeth of seeing Mrs Muscat the Prime Ministers wife deliver her children to school in a statepaid car with a statepaid chauffeurIts bad enough that we know the state is paying for a car and chauffeur for her exclusive use my friend said But what makes it even worse is that she makes the trip with them This morning we had the usual scene right on the school doorstep She gets out of the car in her pink flipflops in this weather and does her usual Byepupiloveyou She should either have the chauffeur take them to school alone or she should drive them herself and leave the chauffeur out of it The sight of Mama and the royal children being chauffeured for the school run was irritating even to begin with Now four years down the line and with her husband sinking in corruption its really and truly getting up all our noses What a sickening sightAs I told my friend you cant expect bogans to understand these things The idea of mama being chauffeured on the school run with her children with everything paid for by the taxes of the husbands of all the other mothers at the gate is actually Bogan Heaven  A friend who works at the state general hospital Mater Dei has just emailed to say that a high level Chinese delegation visited this morning and they have only just left They were in two chauffeurdriven limos and a VIP minibus  Deborah Schembri parliamentary secretary for Lands and Owen Bonnici the Justice Minister are currently leading a government campaign against Jason Azzopardi the shadow minister for justice and Vassallo Builders Group The message they are pushing hard is that Vassallo Builders loaned not donated a quarter of a million euros to the Nationalist Party and in return Jason Azzopardi  when he was the Parliamentary Secretary for Lands  signed over a large tract of land the former site of the failed Löwenbräu brewery for a few hundred thousand euros when it was worth €8 million To add to the conspiracy story Deborah Schembri has also repeated incessantly that she has the sworn testimony of an anonymous eyewitness who told her he saw Jason Azzopardi walking round the land with Nazzareno Vassallo the company CEOHaving investigated the story I am at a loss to decide which is the more shocking the true facts of the case involving John Dalli and Marsovin or the sight and sound of the government brazenly lying when it knows it is lying in a JosephGoebbelsinspired exercise to achieve the double objective of tarnishing its most vociferous critic on the Opposition benches while simultaneously protecting John Dalli who is a consultant to the Prime Minister and Dallis clients the winemakers MarsovinThis is the story and I am going to tell it in chronological order and bald facts so that there is no room for confusionOn 7th November 1990 John Dalli who was then Minister for Economic Affairs in the government led by Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami wrote to the Commissioner of Lands instructing him to give a large tract of stateowned land in Qormi to a company which Marsovin had incorporated with a view to setting up a brewery to make Löwenbräu
beer under licenceDalli told the Commissioner of Lands that the land was to be given to them in perpetuity for an annual ground rent Dalli was not the Minister responsible for government property at the time but he completely bypassed the minister responsible The granting of public land in perpetuity has been described to me as unheard of Albert Mamo a retired public servant who was Commissioner for Lands for many years says that he knows of only two such exceptional cases in his decadeslong career MarsovinAgriCo and Foster Clarks He was speaking to Jason Azzopardi and not directly to this websiteAfter he read my earlier promo for this story an old friend Georges Bonello Dupuis rang me His late father George was Finance Minister in 1990 I remember him coming home steaming with fury about what John Dalli had done he said Its as clear as yesterday He was raging about how Dalli had insisted on transferring a large piece of government land to Marsovin in perpetuity instead of for a fixed period how completely shocking and absurd it was and how Dalli had talked Fenech Adami into believing it had to be done that way My father was furious because he could see what Dalli was up to and as a notary he knew the meaning and the consequences of a deal like that But he couldnt persuade Fenech Adami and Dalli got his way This is reported with Georges Bonello Dupuiss consent his father died seven years agoJohn Dallis letter to the Lands Commissioner saysMessrs Lowenbrau sic Ltd are planning to set up an industrial process for the production of alcoholic and non alcoholic beveragesAs the land which they had originally acquired for this project is not considered by Government as environmentally suitable another site has been identified as shown in the attached planAs this project is considered to be of economic benefit to this country you are requested to take the necessary steps to enter into a lease agreement with the afore mentioned company to grant this land on perpetual emphyteusis at a ground rent of LM5000 a year for the first two years and LM10000 a year thereafterThe usual conditions of the lease as per government policy are to applyOwen Bonnici the Justice Minister spent €13430 on two firstclass return tickets to China for himself and for his private secretary in March last yearBonnici and his private secretary who is unnamed in the item listed among direct orders published in the Government Gazette spent just over a day in China They flew from Malta on 22 March and flew back on 25 March The purpose of their visit was given as to attend a forum  You couldnt make these things up Helena Dalli who has set herself up as the champion of civil liberties and trailblazer for equality has taken the Victorian route or lets say the 20thcentury Maltese backwoods track with her husband publicly challenging the political candidate who called her a bitchAs a grown woman and a cabinet minister with that particular portfolio shouldnt she be fighting her own battles if she thinks they need to be fought at allThis is so embarrassing Patrick Dalli needs to understand that his wife is no longer his wife and that he is not defending her honour in a bar or amongst family or neighbours or against private insultLets put it this way  what would we think if a cabinet ministers wife openly challenged a candidate of the rival party who had insulted her husband Well exactly Equality and all that Mrs DalliAnd Salvu Mallia should not meet Patrick Dalli at all because he would be colluding in this treatment of wives as though they are their husbands chattels If he is to meet anybody at all it should be the Minister herself And I wouldnt do that either because there is no justification she can give for putting both her sons and her sons fiancée on the state payrollStay away Salvu You should never meet a man to discuss his wife Its so southernMediterranean primitive Wives do not belong to husbands If you dont believe me check with the Minister for Equality Also your issue is with how the Minister put her sons and the fiancée on the public payroll  so exactly how do you think her husband is qualified to speak to you about that It was her decision and not his  or is Patrick Dalli now coopted to the cabinet alongside his wifeIt is from Helena Dalli that you need your answers not her husband   Kien ilvera wertit ma taħsibx  This photograph taken on 15th November 2014 shows Owen Bonnici the Minister for Justice buying pillows at TalLira where everything costs a euroHe had left his wife and daughter for Janice Bartolo earlier that year and was setting up home in a mezzanine in Old Mint Street Valletta So he goes to TalLira to buy his personal pillows for a euro and then spends €13400 of taxpayers funds on firstclass flights for himself and for his private secretary to fly to China for just a day so that he can talk bollocks at a Chinese forum about tourism tweet about it  and then fly back to Janice who gets to rest her head on TalLira pillows  Governmentfed stories about Lloyds moving to Malta postBrexit cluttered up some of the newspapers over the last few days You cant believe a single thing that comes out of that laundromat  its disturbing Lloyds itself ruled it out yesterday  One of them is sick and tired of being out of the limelight and the other knows he has been in the limelight a little too much for all the wrong reasons and wants to get people talking about something elseThose who think that Evarist Bartolo is normal and decent because he likes English and is married to Gillian Sammut need to put on their spectacles and take a proper look at whats staring them in the face Even Deborah Schembri who was linked with them in the divorce referendum battle knows enough to stay away from being associated with their latest public relations tactic She has cited previous engagements which I rather suspect are subsequent engagements or none at allSociopolitical developments I think sociopathic developments would be more accurate  Sleazy Anglu Farrugia and shady Marie Louise Coleiro are determined to die in the saddle   The Times of Malta reports this morning  that the cabinet office is finding it too difficult to work out guidelines on how ministers of the government should use their official and personal email addressesBecause its so complicated isnt it How about this use your personal email address to send and receive your personal emails and use your official address to send and receive anything related to your position as a government minister Do not send and receive personal emails using your government address and do not send and receive governmentrelated emails using your personal address People who work for companies and corporations know this I have yet to receive an email from a company employee using his or her Gmail address rather than the companys But apparently for the members of the cabinet this is far too complicated to understand They need a complete book of guidelines and its compilation has very conveniently been stalledThis will allow the bastards  because really thats what they are  to say when caught emailing using their Gmail about shifty contracts to do with cafes and compensation or using their Hotmail when discussing their canvassers corruption to say that they didnt know they werent supposed to do that because there are no guidelinesGovernment exchanges should always be on govmt addresses because they are recorded in the government server and can be retrieved Gmail and Hotmail cant be retrieved And thats exactly why these crooks dont like using their govmt addresses  Those two crooked degenerates Jeffrey Pullicino  and Evarist Bartolo have just held a totally whacky press conference that made them look like a couple of looneytunes You would never believe that one corrupt crackpot is the executive chairman of the Malta Council for Science and Technology and the other is Maltas Education MinisterThat old sod Bartolo must be cracking under the pressure of his massive corruption having been uncovered Pullicino has always been nuts and a violent drunk as two ex wives will testify one of whom has petitioned the courts to have their very brief marriage annulled on that basis among others that include nonconsummationAnd how stupid does a drunkard have to be  oh sorry they spiked his drink again  to stage his press event at a restaurant called Bacchus  How I laughedPublic life in Malta has been hijacked by psychiatric cases and the corrupt    Some adjectives used by the journalists from The Malta Independent the Times of Malta and Malta Today who covered this tragic farce put on by a dissolute 53yearold drunkard and a corrupt pensioner with a serious canvasser problem strange surreal bizarrePullicino and Bartolo did not have quite the effect they intended Context is all chaps  the last time you tried to pull a stunt like this you were working for the Opposition and Gonzi was Prime Minister Its a little different now   He did have one once though didnt he He must have done It must be so uncomfortable to have your chin rest directly on your starched collar I mean what do you do when you need to look down at something FascinatingAnd theres that Bartolo looking a complete shambles His morose Suor Crocefissa expression isnt helped by the fact that he looks like he hasnt slept in a month These two must be such a joy at the breakfast table one ranting and raving in a whiskyfuelled frenzy and the other looking like Gillian poured Mastrolindo or Dettol in his mug by mistake and he drank itWe cant get rid of them soon enough but it looks like not even a stake through the heart will do it  I had an email yesterday reproduced below with her consent from an old friend who left Malta many years ago and who had just read this post about John Dalli Marsovin and the land in Qormi She was a lawyer at MIMCOL Malta Investment Management Company Ltd  the state corporation which the incoming Nationalist government had set up to manage stateowned assets and the Malta Development Corpporation in the early 1990sWhen she read about the ongoing government accusations that Vassallo Builders had bought the Qormi land from the government in 2009 she said she couldnt understand how this was possible because it was Marsovin which held the concession My first thought was that the Marsovin concession must have reverted back to the government because otherwise the government wouldnt have been able to deal with Vassallo I remember the story of the scandalous lease to Marsovin when it happened back then Then I read your reportShe continued Dalli tried to do the same with the Dragonara Casino in 19901991 It took me a great deal of effort with the support of Louis Galea Joinwell Ltd boss not the exminister since deceased  at the time state corporation chairman Professor Joe Ganado and George Bonello Dupuis then Finance Minister furious and with a long string of swearing to stop the deal from going through Dalli who was Minister of Economic Services and really pushing to give the Dragonara Casino to an Austrian company for 99 years threw me out of his office saying I had set off a chain of events that was blocking a good deal for government yeah right I remember the expression he used Min ma jaħxix ma jagħmilx frieħ The company to which he had wanted to hand the Dragonara Casino for a century went bankrupt just two years later Luckily the emphyteusis was for five years and with stringent conditions attached so the government got it back Professor  Ganado represented the Austrian company on the deal but despite being their lawyer he played his part in resisting the 99yearlease demand which Dalli was pushing through the Malta Development Corporation The Lands Department was not involved because the property had been assigned already I do not recall how by the government to Casma Ltd which back then managed the Dragonara Casino The government of Malta was the sole shareholder in Casma Ltd which was in a very bad financial situation  Yesterday morning I had a WhatsApp message from a friend who is from Qormi and who was still living in that town in the early 1990s Bear in mind that Dalli was raised in Qormi and that it was his constituency He was Minister for Economic Services at the timeGood morning Daphne Im reading your article on the Qormi brewery I remember way back in 1990 how furious the fireworks enthusiasts of the St Sebastian feast were at John Dalli for signing off that piece of land to Marsovin They had used it for many years to let off their fireworks I remember Dalli coming in person to the St Sebastian band club to meet this big crowd of angry people trying to convince them that this was necessary and ultimately in their childrens interests as most of them would be employed at the brewery Secondly I am quite sure that John Sciberras formerly of the Lands Department was involved in dropping that clause freeing the land from all conditions on use He is very close to John Dalli and was still at the Lands Department until Jason Azzopardi was made Parliamentary Secretary for Lands But he maintained his close links to the department and obviously knew everyone thereWhen I telephoned John Sciberras for comment he denied all involvement He was no longer directorgeneral of the Government Property Division at the time he said Sciberras however is a consultant to the Office of the Prime Minister on government property and is noted in the National Audit Office report on the matter as having been directly involved in the scandalous Café Premier deal with Prime Minister Muscat orchestrated by Gmail exchange  UPDATE An important point has just occurred to me which should be obvious but which has been missed Muscat and Konrad Mizzi and the government trolls who pollute the commentsboards keep insisting that what Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri did was not illegal But if it were not illegal  criminal because the police only deal with crimes and not with breaches of civil law  Manfred Galdes would not have given the FIAU report directly to the Police Commissioner with a request for actionThere you have the surest evidence yet that Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi wereare involved in criminal activity
