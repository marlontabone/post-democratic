read this story  in the malta independent sven giegold a member of the european parliaments panama papers committee has made the same point i have been making here for months that the governments supposed audit by a private firm of konrad mizzis dealings is ridiculous and pointless given that there has been a specialised forensic audit already by a state department empowered to seek information across countries under the law  the financial intelligence analysis unitthe financial intelligence analysis unit when it was led by manfred galdes investigated the key figures involved in the panama papers fallout and transferred its report to the then commissioner of police michael cassar who then took extended leave of absence from work and never returned announcing his resignation instead some weeks later galdes himself resigned no doubt over the failure of the police to act on his units investigationwhat giegold doesnt seem to know however is that as far as muscat and the government he leads are concerned the general public does not know about that fiau report because the only place where its existence has been reported is on this website i was able to report it after sources at the police headquarters confirmed to me that commissioner michael cassar had met manfred galdes then the fiau chief who had presented him with the report and asked for actionthe whereabouts of that report after cassars departure are now unknownpretending that there is no fiau report and ignoring the facts specified on this website has allowed the prime minister and konrad mizzi to keep talking about a private audit commissioned from a consultancy firm safe in the knowledge that nobody  except me and now giegold  is going to say to them you dont need a private audit you have a massive and thorough forensic investigation report carried out by the fiau in the police commissioners office and probably still on file at the fiau unless somebody has destroyed all records of it  the sunday times reports this morning that tourism minister ed zl has been taken off air maltas case and that the airlines fate has been placed in the hands of the deputy prime minister louis grech in case youd forgotten with joe capello as his consultantperhaps they think you can solve the problems of the present and future by resurrecting the ghosts of the past louis grech who turns 70 in a few weeks was air maltas chairman in the past when joe capello was the ceothe incoming labour government got rid of peter davies  cutting off its nose to spite its face only to create this terrible messcreaking open the door to the fossil cabinet and bringing back louis grech who is supposed to be the deputy pm and joe capello who is supposed to be retired means that they are blasting back to the past and giving those two men bigger air malta problems now than they could solve back when they were directly in chargeit also means that the current chairman maria micallef has effectively been rendered redundant i have been meaning to comment about her presence all over the newspapers and in the negotiations for a while now anyway maria micallef is the chairman and not the ceo which means that she should have been nowhere in sight while the ceo took the decisions but air maltas ceo philip micallef quietly resigned last august without a word in the press and he hasnt been replaced since he was never quoted by journalists who went directly to maria micallef who then failed to direct them to the ceo who is the one who should be taking questions from the press about the company instead she fronted for the airline herself and also spoke about airline matters related to negotiations when that is 100 the ceos businessphilip micallef who left a position as chief of a regulatory authority in bermuda to return to malta for the air malta position himself replaced louis giordmaina formerly of lufthansa technik in the job giordmaina was appointed air malta ceo by the incoming labour government in 2013 but left after less than a year   seven months after the resignation of manfred galdes  the financial intelligence analysis unit remains without a director you will see from this organisational chart that in the absence of a director there is nobody to give direction to the unitthe fiaus board of governors is chaired by the attorney general a great pal of the current government who not even been embarrassed to blur boundaries by sharing a box at the theatre  with the justice minister and his girlfriend a labour party television propagandistthe attorneygeneral should be challenged about the state of affairs at the financial intelligence analysis unit and about his several conflicts of interest in his public roles and personal alliances  update i have since obtained luciano busuttils number and have been trying to ring him the first few times he hit the reject button now the calls go straight through to voicemailon 30 december i received the photograph below from a friend who was in victoria gozo at around midday a very reliable friend  he is a senior school official the car in the photograph is the statefunded vehicle used by luciano busuttil the labour mp who chairs the malta sports council it is parked in a slot reserved for the disabled busuttil will now write to the data protection commissioner as he has done once already to complain that i revealed his numberplate publicly and that i should be ordered to remove it however showing his numberplate is essential as otherwise that could be any old car and you would have to take it on trust that it is his which is just not onmy friend wrote luciano busuttil has parked in a disabled parking spot in full view of everyone outside arkadia with complete indifference i have confirmed that he doesnt have a disabled parking badge on his cari replied hes not even remotely disabled except for flat feetmy friend wrote back having checked the car windscreen a little while later he now appears to have a disabled parking badge amazing and absolutely no one in his entourage was even remotely disabled  clearly the man must have a disability badge as a way of always finding available parking what utter scum im just waiting for him to pontificate about how they care about the elderly and disabled they have no shamebecause the photo and story arrived in the festive rush i failed to upload it immediately and then it got buried in a stack of other things but this afternoon i received an email from another person who i do not know and so i remembered about itdo you know that luciano busuttils wife dorothy has a handicapped permit her husbands statepaid driver takes their children to school so that she can be at the office  a taghna lkoll job at the malta gaming authority  on time she doesnt need to hassle for parking when she gets to smart city where she works because she has a disabled badge but she doesnt look disabled at all not with those high heels she arrives between 730am and 745am in a white alfa romeo giulietta and slips straight into a parking bay reserved for the handicappedsince i rang luciano busuttil about the fake mark abela facebook profile which he used to try to pick up women i have changed my phone and lost his number so i am waiting for a colleague to send it to me however should the labour mp and malta sports council chairman wish to ring me meanwhile to explain why both he and his wife have been issued with disabled parking badges he may do so at any time  i sent luciano busuttil a message asking him to return my call on the matter of this post he has just done so having read the post already including the bit where i wrote that he hit the callreject button when i rangi will reproduce our telephone conversation as best i can because i have been rendered almost speechless at the abusive nerve of these peoplelb im sorry i didnt answer your call but bhalissa qieghed naqra busyme thank you for returning it anyway its about your and your wifes use of disabled parking badges on your carslb yes yes yes very easy to explain my wife has a disabled parking stickerme but she isnt disabledlb stenna stenna let me explain in may 2013 she had a bad traffic accident and was in a wheelchair for a while some of her injuries were permanent she got a disabled parking sticker in 2013 for two years and in 2015 it was renewed for another two yearsme what is her disability the sort of disability that allows her to spend all day in fiveinch heelslb dak mghandhux jaqsam she can wear high heels but she cant walkme maybe if she didnt wear fiveinch heels she would be able to walklb she can walk she just cant walk long distancesme so she cant walk from a normal parking space to the shops or from the smart city car park to her office but then she can spend hours at parties and receptions standing in pointed shoes with high heelslb she cant stand for a long time she doesnt come with me to partiesme maybe she goes to parties with mark abela instead why do you use her disabled parking badge on your car and park in disabled parking slots when youre driving your own carlb thats because shes with me in the carme what a lousy excuse that badge is for disabled people driving their own car or for people too disabled to be dropped off by others at their destination or on the pavement why are you blocking a disabled parking space when you could easily deposit her at your destination go off and park somewhere civilised and walk back to meet her youre not disabled for example  that anecdote and photo ive just uploaded saying that you parked in the disabled parking spot near arkadia in gozo when you had a whole bunch of passengers why didnt you drop your wife off at arkadia with the other people and go off and park in a normal space instead of blocking a disabled parking bay that a person who is actually disabled might need to uselb its because she cant stand and wait for meme resisting the urge to suggest that she buys a pair of sneakers youre joking right by that same token my elderly parents should be using a disabled parking sticker like many other peoples so that my father doesnt have to drop my mother off go off and park and then walk back to meet her but theyre not going to apply for one because theyre not going to block a disabled parking bay when there are wheelchairbound people driving their own cars who are you kidding its not as though people dont see mrs busuttil running around looking anything but disabled you got that disabled badge abusively because you got it in 2013 and it was renewed abusively because nobody wants to say no to a member of the labour power brigadelb dak int qed tghidu ghax mohhok flabbuz talpoter mhux hekk ktibt abuse of powerme yes i think you are totally abusive of your position as it happens its completely disgustinglb i have to go now because i am at a meeting about the presidencyme gosh youre very importantlb yes its very importantme no i said youre very important and apparently also disabledhe rings off so now we know dorothy busuttil who shows absolutely no signs of physical impairment and is never seen without what are known in the business as tarts trotters is classified as disabled and has used a disabled parking sticker for the last four years as has her husband luciano blocking disabled parking bays with a bogan disregard for others taghna lkoll  so that would be why hes selling so many passports and residence visas to gulf arabs russians and chinese to make malta more cosmopolitanmeanwhile hes taking his first steps towards the physical side of the cosmopolitan look with plans for lots of nice skyscrapers  and he gets a good answer too also shouldnt the education minister a university lecturer be quoting from source rather than just googling facebookfriendly quotes but hell be hard pushed to find a source for that one the clue is in the use of revenge as a verb one takes revenge one does not revenge but im sure the man who pretends to love english so as to pick up the votes of undiscriminating pepe types knows that alreadysuch rubbish  even in the education ministry  stephen bonellos cartoon in the sunday times today  i love it  britains supreme court has ruled today that the referendum result on britains exit from the european union does not give the government a mandate and that the matter must be decided by parliamentthis is a timely reminder that in representative democracies there can be no government by mob rule  and a referendum is essentially not an exercise in democracy but in mob rulethe referendum is of great political significance but the act of parliament which established it did not say what should happen as a result so any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the uk constitution namely by an act of parliament david neuberger the president of the supreme court said when reading the judgement to proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuriesit is also a reminder  to us in malta too as our system is the same  that the supremacy of parliament is greater than that of the government and that the government is only the government because it commands the greater number of seats in parliament it cannot act without parliamentthis is also testament to the power of a single individual in a true democracy with functional institutions to challenge the government with recourse to the constitution the case was set in motion by gina miller an investment adviser who challenged the governments decision to take britain out of the european union without a parliamentary vote of consentshe won the case in the court of first instance the government appealed and lost  disgraced former european commissioner john dalli a consultant to prime minister muscat has made a formal request to the police to prosecute me for harassing himi will keep you updated on this matter meanwhile i am seeking advice on aspects related to constitutional law and human rights in readiness to challenge this abuse of power and violation of my rights to freedom of expression as an ordinary citizen and above all as a journalist with the duty to hold people like him to accountthe police apparently wish to interrogate me about my attempts at harassing the prime ministers consultant they had better prepare a warrant for my arrest  which is going to look spectacularly good and even better while malta holds the presidency of the european council  because i am not going to comply on principlethe police believe that they have got to comply when they receive a formal request for prosecution kwerela and then it is up to the courts to decide but they are wrong the process of interrogation prosecution criminal charges interminable court appearances and legal costs is in itself a form of harassment most especially when used by politicians and others in power against the journalists who draw public attention to their wrongdoing abuse and multiple failingsit has what the european court of human rights calls a chilling effect on journalists and is fundamentally abusive in itselfif john dalli thinks i have lied about him or distorted the facts in his regard then he has recourse to the law under the press act for libel he can file a civil suit as normal people dobut instructing the police to harass and prosecute a journalist for writing about him is something straight out of the states with which dalli and his client joseph muscat are most comfortable  i listened to david thakes show on radio 101 yesterday he tried to ring labour mp luciano busuttil repeatedly about this matter  each time busuttil hit the callreject buttonthake has just opened his show today with another attempt at ringing him and again busuttil hit the callreject button because theres not much he can say is there his wife isnt even remotely disabled and yet she has used a disabledparking badge on her car for four years and busuttil himself transfers it to his car for family outings so that no member of the busuttil entourage has to walk anywhere dorothy busuttil arrives at her destination armed with a disabledparking badge slips into a disabledparking spot and gets out to race around in shoes with skyscraper heels the sort which have you standing effectively on tiptoe with your toes trapped in a vicetrid tkun ilvera bogan  is there any opportunity provided by their being in power that they wont exploit having created it for their very purpose in the first placeand we keep forgetting that its not really a triad because theres a fourth person very tightly involved with joseph muscat keith schembri and konrad mizzi phyllis muscatso joseph muscat konrad mizzi and keith schembri sign over several of maltas public hospitals to a shady front man called ram tumuluri saying that it will help with medical tourism and then inevitably we discover that phyllis muscat has set up an office to handle medical tourism to malta with another taghna lkoller called claire cassar neither of them has any experience at all in the sector but amazingly temos has found them to be ideal  for the same purposes an international company would find somebody to be ideal in a corrupt dictatorshipthats how bad things have become here those avaricious individuals are not just sucking the trough dry but also creating more and more troughs in which to wallowread more here  isnt it obvious its going to be in march next year thats when the five years are up nobody with even the most basic insight into how those minds work would have imagined it would be any earlier than that  later if anything to give them more time to cover their tracks delete evidence make themselves safe from investigation and prosecution fit in a little more haymaking and fight hard to avoid a situation in which they have to face the police a lot sooner than they thinkmela ħasibna ċwieċ  has it gone to their heads or what it looks like all these labour bastards began cheating on their wives and the mothers of their children as soon as they got into power its just one after the other and then not content with that they bring their girlfriends on board the gravytrain tooalfred mifsud is the deputy governor of the central bank of malta for heavens sake a sex cheat sending messages to his secret girlfriend while the mother of his children is sitting opposite him at a restaurant table then filing a court case to have her and their children evicted from their home on the grounds that he owns it and it is registered in his name what sort of person does that to his children cheat on their mother and then go to court to force them out of their home so that his girlfriend can use it instead i mean reallyits not as though we should expect everybody in public life to be some kind of pillar of moral rectitude but there are limits and this is the deputy governor of the central bank somebody who should command respect the only reason that he isnt actually governor of the central bank is that i reported this story detailed in court this morning  just in time to stop this cheating shambles being put in charge of maltas most important financial institutionmen who cheat on the mother of their children will cheat on anything  as in fact happened   malta was 37th on transparency internationals corruption perceptions index in 2015 in 2016 it sank to 47th place and now ranks below the bahamasit was the year when the world discovered that maltas energy minister konrad mizzi and the prime ministers chief of staff keith schembri had begun the process to set up covert companies in panama sheltered by secret trusts in new zealand just days after coming to power in march 2013 and that the prime minister isnt able or willing to do anything about it because a third panama company associated with theirs is almost certainly hisit was the year when people watched as the commissioner of police resigned rather than do anything about the chief of the financial intelligence analysis unit left his post in despair labour party functionaries and failed politicians were made magistrates and judges state councils institutions government departments commissions and committees were ethnically cleansed even further to give the government absolute control and the ability to instil fear in others through the threat of retaliatory measures and vengeancehospitals the power station skyscrapers public transport public appointments the jordanian university of bribes and baksheesh represented in malta by the labour partys longtime auditor  nothing has been left untainted by corruption and scandalthis is the supposedly liberal and progressive most transparent government ever in the history of malta and then the corrupt idiots actually imagine that lloyds is going to set up its new headquarters in this filthy place with such a bad reputation post brexit they got put in their place pretty rapidly on that one  read this story  in the times of malta this morning over the last few weeks this website has featured photographs of the kind of planes air malta has been wetleasing and the complaints of passengers who booked a flight with air malta and ended up on a converted cargo plane or a tacky ellinair aircraft with nonfunctioning lavatoriesthats what you get when you rope in the manager of the islands cocacola bottling plant to run the national airline  while shes still running the cocacola bottling plant maria micallef is air maltas chairman but already shes seen off two wellrespected ceos louis giordmaina formerly of lufthansa technik and philip micallef formerly of the malta communications authority to plant herself on centrestage and serve the governments specialised interests rather than those of the airline itself and no doubt her own interests too because she even sought and gained advantage for her unemployable boyfriendso the incoming labour government removed air maltas then ceo peter davis in 2013 after years of campaigning against him while they were in opposition saying he was paid too much and that a maltese person could do it because you know how it is malta is teeming with aviation industry crisis management specialists and they installed the manager of a soft drinks bottling plant instead and are now probably wondering why the crisis downwardspiralled into a catastrophethe trouble with the labour party is that they think anybody can do any job with no special skills required look at them  look at every decision theyve taken its all been based on that assumption they give a power station contract to maltese tinpot businessmen who run car dealerships and hotels and build flats they sign over maltas public hospital to a canadianindian fraudster who couldnt even run a guesthouse without bankrupting it they install people in public positions who have neither the skills nor the track record to qualify them for the job its just horrendous  i have read this report in the times of malta  and watched the embedded video interview with mario demarco deputy leader of the nationalist party i will try to be as tactful as possiblethe trouble with this country is that people dont understand the meaning of the word choices which cohabits with that other alien word decisions maltese people want to wear lots of hats simultaneously and think they have a divine right not to be criticised if they cant cope with all of them and other maltese people who think this state of affairs is entirely normal speak and behave as though the job or post should accommodate the person when everywhere else in the civilised normal world its the other way round the inability to cope due to illness is not a justified excuse to fend off those who point out that you are failing to deliver you cant cry oh but im too ill to cope illness is a reason for resignation if you are in a ceo or deputy ceo position because the nature of that position means that you cannot be temporarily replaced or filled in for and that the functioning of the organisation depends on your pulling your full weight those who care about their duties more than they care about themselves dont stay in situ while the job fails to get done and then get angry and hurt when they are reminded that they are there to do a job and that the job has got to be doneas i said to mario demarco myself when he rang me the day i wrote what i did  we spoke for a long time and much of it was personal confidential and cant be reported  when his medical problems are of that nature what he needs most of all is peace of mind and as little stress as possible i cant understand why youre not prioritising i said to him there are no supermen in this world in your position i would have stepped down i cant imagine having to cope with such a serious medical problem while stressing out about all the other stuff what on earth forit is plainly obvious to any sensible person that demarco has got to make a choice it is too late now to make the choice to leave the deputy leadership  the general election is just a year away and that choice should have been made as soon as he was diagnosed so the choice he has to make now is to throw his entire weight behind the campaign to get rid of the corrupt government lying low and crying illness is simply not an option besides which the same complaints were made about his invisibility back in the electoral campaign of 2013 and he wasnt ill or undergoing surgery back theni am not one to say things behind peoples backs rather than straight to their faces so unlike all those who are muttering that demarco is as invisible now as he was in the general election campaign i said what i think when we spoke on the phone i said to him that it is not possible for any human being to cope with a demanding professional practice a seat in parliament and a constituency a position as deputy leader of a political party which has to fight a tough electoral battle while restructuring the party itself a young family and also a very serious illness which has twice required major surgery and which has had permanent debilitating consequences both physical and psychological it is impossible to do all that so something has to go mario demarco never wanted to go into politics he absolutely detests the limelight and is a very private person that is the real reason he failed to speak publicly about his illness and not because he wished to conceal information from the public for nefarious ends like that other one in the auberge de castille but this is the classic heatandkitchen scenario he is also shy selfconscious and extremely reserved these are good qualities in a man but they are not good qualities for fighting dangerous electoral battlesdemarco wanted to be a lawyer working in new york he said as much once in an interview but most of us knew that anyway he went into politics for his father and he has stayed on as a tribute to his father and unfortunately it shows as he himself says unlike his father he is not a political animal at all and as it happens thats exactly why i like him and think he has made enough sacrifices to fulfil the wishes of others now its time to do what he really wants to do which clearly isnt politics instead of listening to the aides who want him back in power so that they can be in power themselves he should listen to his own heart and i told him this myselfmario demarco is at a personal crossroads he must now choose between putting his true nature aside staying on as deputy leader of the nationalist party and fighting hard against government corruption or stepping down to follow his own heart for the first time we dont get to live our lives twice over  robert abela is a nasty piece of work who spent five years freeloading at three palaces with his labour party executive wife lydia when his father was head of state but who then had no problem of conscience in taking to a mass meeting stage to verbally knife the man who made it possible prime minister gonzi  the very same man who also made it possible for his law firm to get the malta planning authority legalcounsel contract for years and years and years disgustingnow today robert abela is out to prove that as well as being a freeloading bum who grabs what he can no matter who is in government hes also good at playing at stupid sitting side by side with owen bonnici  he told the press that zaren vassallo of vassallo builders lied when he said he paid €8 million to marsovin for the qormi land because he only paid €900000 and absorbed €71 million of their brewery debtswho are they trying to kid they speak to even intelligent audiences as though theyre the congregation at one of silvio parniss coffee mornings and unfortunately the newspapers dont help because instead of putting the facts into context they run with the headline that labour wantsi was immediately swamped by emails from people who read the story and were shocked at what robert abela had said how can he be so stupid was the general tone when you buy a company and agree to absorb its debts the debts are factored into the price you pay if you absorb €71 million of the companys debts and pay the shareholders €900000 youve paid €8 million for the company  absorbing the debts means youre paying them yourself youve bought the company the company for €8 million but because it is saddled with debts of €71 million which you have got to pay yourself you give the shareholders €900000a reader who is a corporate financial controller wrote in no wonder theyre making such a bloody mess if they cant understand something so basicand to demonstrate that it is robert abela and the justice minister who are lying or damned stupid heres something that i hadnt bothered to upload with my original report about the subject  though it looks like i should have the actual contract of purchase for the sum of €8 million  you couldnt make these freeloading bogans up perhaps mrs luciano busuttil will now write us a little explanation of how she came to be put on the payroll at the malta gaming authority after taghna lkoll got into power and the malta gaming authority was turned into a labour snakepitnote to dorothy everywhere in europe the only women who wear makeup like that especially in the daytime are hookers thick masklike makeup in the european context is socially unacceptable for roughly the same reason as actual masks are      all you had to do was look at who nominated them and who they nominated heres maria micallef air malta chairman back in the summer of 2014 when this ridiculous business was all the rage michelle muscat nominated her she says  and she herself nominates phyllis muscat what can i say cute      time for a memoryrefresh three months after labour won the general elections joseph muscat called the press to the office of the prime minister and presented them with john dalli announcing that a man of such great talent should not go to waste and that he required dallis excellent skills in a decisionmaking position it later emerged that this decisionmaking position concerned public hospitals and dalli immediately installed himself at the state general hospital along with his daughterthis announcement see videos below took place on 14 june 10 days after konrad mizzis hearnville inc and keith schembris tillgate inc were incorporated in panama egrant inc the name of whose ultimate beneficial owner was not recorded in the panama papers emailcache because it was given over skype was incorporated on 4 july  youd think that politicians and activists who work for political parties would know that the descriptors moderate and extremist refer to ideology and policy but with the labour party thats not the case  largely because the words policy and ideology mean nothing to them labour thinks in these terms power  money contracts and jobsin politics an extremist is somebody who espouses far right ideology kick out immigrants for example or malta for the maltese or at the other end of the spectrum somebody who passes a law saying that you can change your gender by going to a notary and having a deed drawn up  no need for surgery or anything like thatmoderates meanwhile are nice civilised people who just want a quiet public life with no corrupt politicians respect the rights of others and believe in freedom of expression without the pollution of government aides trying to frighten critics into silence  among other thingsbut thats not how the labour partygovernment reads it to those ignorant goons moderates are people who dont criticise the labour party much or nationalist politicians who give labour a free or easy ride and extremists are those who give corrupt labour the bollocking it deserves so i who am not involved in politics at all and who espouses the most moderate kind of political ideology liberal far removed from the extremes of right and left am an extremist for calling out the labour government on its shocking corruption and for pointing out that when we out here are relying on the nationalist party to rid us of those criminals those nationalist politicians who are not pulling their weight either because they are unable or unwilling to do so are letting us downthe definition of a political extremist is not a citizen or journalist with an extreme desire to see the back of this corrupt and abusive outfit thats the definition of a normal decent personbut the defining characteristic of the malta labour party other than abuse and corruption is ignorance about the meaning of words and concepts  if the corrupt cabal in government are reduced to wheeling out owen talajkla to go after jason azzopardi with the help of the super one cameras theyre not getting anywhere fast because the whole thing reeks of desperationthey are however putting the usually calm and collected azzopardi under massive amounts of psychological stress to the point where it shows that he cant focus in his usual manner ad that is exactly why the governmentlabour party are going after him he now looks and feels hunted by malign people in power which has been the intention all alongthat would be why he took the illconceived decision to ring the police when he found the labour party cameras and propagandists outside his office it was a decision he wouldnt have taken if he were thinking clearly when the mental fog lifted he apologisedazzopardi has open lines of communications with journalists in the independent press he is one of the most accessible politicians in that respect we all know that he takes calls returns them messages with an apology if he cant answer the phone gives answers and promises to get the answer if he cant do it there and then and does soit was so unjust therefore that the ridiculous institute of maltese journalists issued a statement taking him to task for ringing the police when he found labour party employees with their cameras outside his office have they ever leaped to my defence in that way no much how much harassment i have gone through at the hands of the police and politicians no and i actually am a journalist rather than an employee of a political party the institute of maltese journalists is politically motivedthe employees of political parties are not journalists in the real sense of the word and it is high time this important point is considered and the distinction made the fundamental principles which underpin the protection and special status of journalists under the law are based on the fact that journalists act in the service of the public by holding politicians and others in high public office to account it stands to reason that if somebody is paid to work for politicians on the payroll of a political party then he is in the service of the politicians he is meant to scrutinise and not in the service of the publicthe people hounding jason azzopardi and hanging around his office door are not journalists but labour party employees and the sooner we get this straight the better they dont even make any attempt at pretending that what they are doing is journalism and they are not after the truth or the facts but are there as agents of the governing party to harass politicians of the rival opposition party that is not an exercise in democracy and freedom of expression but the precise oppositewhich brings me to another related point the labour party is in government it is in power it should understand that the tactics it used when in opposition look really very ugly now it is one thing sending your party employees and party cameras to harass government politicians when you are in opposition but the governing party sending its party employees and cameras to harass opposition politicians and critics of the government thats absolutely terrible  and it is being read as terrible if not in malta then certainly outside malta those are totalitarian tactics and in the civilised world they are viewed with disgust and dismaymeanwhile i have a message for all those intellectually challenged members of the maltese chattering class  and god knows its pretty big  who are oohing and aahing because poor mario demarco has been attacked by a blogpost on this website are you all out of your tiny minds havent you bloody noticed that the nationalist politician who really is under attack is jason azzopardi by the governing party and its entire mammoth party media machine how about focussing your idiotic minds for a change  as though the mess you made in 2013 wasnt bad enough  and work out what is going on who really needs your support and who is really doing some actual attacking  there has been a strange show of alliance between the labour partygovernment and one of the nationalist partys deputy leaders mario demarco over the last few days we were even subjected to the unsavoury spectacle of keith schembri the prime ministers corrupt chief of staff posting a message of support on demarcos facebook page and demarco returning the compliment in an interview he gave to the times of maltawhy doesnt anybody see anything peculiar in the way the labour party never touches mario demarco that quite to the contrary it actually goes out of its way to support him from the way they talk youd think he was a labour politician one of theirspeoples minds just dont work on this island they dont join the dots they never see whats staring them in the face even if it has pink bells on but then they believe conspiracy theories and the more outlandish the bettermario demarco and keith schembri the prime ministers corrupt chief of staff have adrian hillman the corrupt former managing direct of allied newspapers ltd in common  though not for the same reasons if you want to read up on the backstory to adrian hillmans corruption with keith schembri or maybe youve forgotten already just enter his name into the search box at the top of this pagemario demarco and adrian hillman have been best friends all their lives and it was mario demarcos father who installed hillman at allied newspapers and had him anointed as the single replacement for both progress presss wilfred asciak and allied newspapers ronnie agius when they retireddemarco had no knowledge of hillmans corruption and the exact nature of his friendship with the labour partys keith schembri though there is no way he couldnt have known that there was a close relationship did he never wonder about itdemarco has since broken off all contact with hillman because of the massive betrayal of trust but the fact remains that keith schembri was never going to direct the labour party to launch any kind of onslaught on demarco as long as he was best friends with his corrupt associate hillman he is still protecting demarco now as we can see from the comment he left on his facebook page and this only makes me wonder who knows what about whom among those three peoplewe still dont know exactly what is going on beneath the surface there and nobody  not the nationalist party not the times of malta and certainly not the labour party  seems to have any interest in reminding people that the prime ministers chief of staff was involved in corrupt dealings with the managing director of maltas most influential newspaper and printing press during the years 2011 to 2015 which covered an extremely turbulent period in politics and also the 2013 general election campaign the nationalist partys deputy leader has no interest in reminding people about this massive scandal because one of the people involved was his best friend a very painful situation for him at a personal level and the labour party wants people to forget because it involves the prime ministers corrupt chief of staff and for obvious reasons its a story the times of malta is not going to keep alive malta today for reasons that remain unclear never touches keith schembri and didnt even go after him when his web of secret companies was revealed this is how situations turn foul in malta with a great conspiracy of silence about the most dangerous people while those who shouldnt be persecuted by the press and politicians are  the national commission for the disabled has reported labour mp luciano busuttil and his wife dorothy to the police for abusive possession of a blue badge which entitles the holder to park in spaces reserved for the disabled the police have been requested to seize the badge and to investigate the mattermrs busuttil has used the disabled parking badge for four years having acquired it through unclear means in 2013 supposedly after a car accident she has no signs of any disability at all still less the severely impaired mobility which is the primary requirement for entitlement to use a disabled parking bay mrs busuttil can walk normally and is never seen without a pair of high heels which she wears even to the office when out with her children and for daily errandsthe story began here  and then escalated with this post which

had immediately launched an inquiry after this report and this telephone conversation  labour mp luciano busuttil who is also  cynically not ironically  chairman of the national sports council released a statement saying that he never held a disabledparking badge or used his wifesthat was not however the national commission for the disableds reason for asking the police to seize it nor was it the main item in my reports on this website it was something else entirely that mrs busuttil herself is not entitled to use parking space reserved for the disabled because she does not have impaired mobility in other words because she can walk and also spends her entire day in very high heelsbut when he says that he never used his wifes abusively acquired disabledparking badge he is lying the photograph below shows luciano busuttils car  his car not his wifes  parking squarely in the disabledparking bay outside arkadia in victoria
