Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets.

Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  

  
I have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.
Watch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.
And this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.
The Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.
This is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.
Jeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition
By that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’
And then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’
Sant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.
He had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.
Sant calls the police
When he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.
The days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant
Pullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.
My mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.
He had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’
I was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.
Alfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.
As he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.
Just as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.
I’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  

  
I have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.
Watch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.
And this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.
The Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.
This is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.
Jeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition
By that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’
And then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’
Sant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.
He had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.
Sant calls the police
When he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.
The days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant
Pullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.
My mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.
He had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’
I was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.
Alfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.
As he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.
Just as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.
I’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.
  

  
They told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.
It looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.
Two weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.
Chicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess
The television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.
Highly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.
Super One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.
Wig glued on tight
It didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.
Paired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.
Massing for war
I didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.
There wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.
Had Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.
Jo Said wants a bodyguard
Last week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.
Said copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’
That evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.
‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’
So Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.
And now here’s Jo Said again
Did you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.
Today I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.
In this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’
Fascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.
You know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  

  
I have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.
Watch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.
And this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.
The Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.
This is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.
Jeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition
By that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’
And then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’
Sant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.
He had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.
Sant calls the police
When he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.
The days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant
Pullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.
My mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.
He had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’
I was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.
Alfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.
As he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.
Just as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.
I’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.
  

  
They told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.
It looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.
Two weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.
Chicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess
The television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.
Highly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.
Super One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.
Wig glued on tight
It didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.
Paired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.
Massing for war
I didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.
There wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.
Had Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.
Jo Said wants a bodyguard
Last week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.
Said copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’
That evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.
‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’
So Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.
And now here’s Jo Said again
Did you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.
Today I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.
In this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’
Fascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.
You know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.
  

  
I’ve just finished watching BondiPlus. It turns out that just before Labour made such a great fuss about the Safi supermarket permit resignations at the MEPA (the project is one of Charles Polidano’s), Labour’s Lion of Change was seen eating lunch with Ic-Caqnu himself – his guest at the Le Meridien in St Julian’s. I wonder what he chose off the menu – half an ox, probably.
You can’t do anything on this island, can you?
And so the lovely Rachel Attard found out and confronted the unlovely Alfred Sant under one of his many tents. Sant answered her with the question we have all come to expect from him now, ‘Ghaliex le?’ I’ll put the rest of his reply in English, to save my having to translate for our international viewers: ‘If they were eating together, I hope it was a nice meal in an informal context. Can’t one person eat with another?’
Apparently not, because when Sant’s stork-like sidekick Charlon Gouder found a years-old photograph of Jesmond Mugliett having dinner with the architect Robert Sant – who is now working on the infamous bridge – he stalked the prime minister with it in his hands for days. You have to hand it to Charlon: he’s a single-issue man. His obsessions verge on perversion.
So let’s see now – why would the Lion of Change have been lunching a deux with Charles Polidano, one of the barons that Labour dislikes so much, saying that he gets whatever he wants from this government? Perhaps the Lion of Change was dispatched to secure a donation for his party’s coffers. We know that Labour are such bad financial managers that they’re always broke. They pay their people peanuts, and when I won a libel suit against them, and they had to pay me around Lm600 (Joseph Muscat was required to pay another Lm600), my lawyer ended up having to place a warrant of seizure on all their bank accounts – and still we just couldn’t find that Lm600. I had to call Jason Micallef and threaten to send in the bailiffs for Alfred Sant’s desk and computer and finally I got a cheque in the mail.
That’s Labour for you. Then they want to tell this government how to make the economy grow by 4% (when it’s growing by 4% already – oh sorry, that was a misprint; we meant 6%).
Watch your tongue, Gunther Verheugen
Gunther Verheugen put in an appearance in the 2003 general election, reminding us that what the Nationalist Party says about Europe isn’t spin but fact. It seems that the people of Malta won’t believe their own prime minister and must have outside confirmation. Needs must when the devil drives.
Now here’s Verheugen again, interviewed via satellite link for BondiPlus, telling us that what Sant says he’s going to do isn’t ‘legally possible’, and even if he were to attempt the impossible and try, he’s going to have to knock on 26 prime ministerial doors and make his case to each and every one of them. That’s something that has never happened before, Verheugen said.
Sant wasn’t on the show to say that he’d bite off his long tongue, like he did last time, but his old friend Evarist Bartolo was, as slimy, snake-like and underhand as ever. And what is this problem that Labour people have with heckling the prime ministers they don’t agree with? My abiding memory of the 2003 general election is of Sant heckling Fenech Adami in that washerwoman’s voice he uses when he’s cross, even as the credits rolled in the last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign.
Now here was Evarist Bartolo, talking over the prime minister and interrupting him, not letting him say that the reason Malta is in the Eurozone in the first place is because Sant is wrong about Malta being in a financial mess. You can’t be in a financial mess when you enter the Eurozone. It’s not allowed. If Gonzi were of the washerwoman frame of mind, like Bartolo is despite pretending to be an intellectual like Sant, he might have said: ‘The Labour Party would know all about finances that are in a mess, wouldn’t it?’ But he’s not that kind of man, and that’s why people prefer him to The Other One.
Gonzi coins a slogan for Labour
‘Aghzel Labour ghax ihammeg’ – a sort of reverse washing-powder, perhaps. Throw a dash of Labour in your washing-machine and your laundry comes out dirty and stinking.
I have a theory about Sant and the EU
He keeps repeating that the referendum result counted for nothing in his book, that he has no regrets about his stance on EU membership, and that the only verdict he rates is the verdict in a general election.
Now he lists the various fights he intends to pick with the European Union. He also has one of those dreadfully incapacitating mindsets that allows for no revision of a fixed view. People miss this fact because on other matters, Sant chops and changes as he goes along, all in the interests of opportunism. But those are minor issues as far as he’s concerned. On his major, life-defining issue of EU membership for Malta, he hasn’t changed his tune for 40 years, and he isn’t going to.
So, taking all these factors and clues into consideration, this is what he’s revving up to do. First he makes it plain that he’s still Eurosceptic and that he plans to ‘renegotiate’ with Europe. That way, we are forewarned of his intentions, and if we elect him prime minister, he will consider himself as having a mandate to press forward with his Eurosceptic approach and his attempts at renegotiation.
When his renegotiation attempts fail at the first hurdle, he’ll begin trying to pull us away from, and ultimately out of, the European Union. Because he doesn’t believe in referendums, but only in general elections, he won’t even ask us for our opinion. We can march and mass and protest in streets and squares as we did in the 1980s, and he’ll just ignore us and tell us that the result of a general election is what counts, and we voted for him to renegotiate with Europe.
Gonzi keeps asking why there is nothing in Labour’s electoral programme about what they plan to do with the €855 million in funds that will come in from the EU. Well, that’s the reason why. Sant’s plan is to have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU, still less with its funds. It’s dirty money to him. Show him a bunch of euros, and he recoils. I haven’t heard him say the word ‘euro’ once in this entire campaign.
If he has his way, there’ll be no funds to bother about because there’ll be no EU membership to bother about either.
He still hasn’t forgiven us for voting Yes in that referendum. He really can’t stand us for doing it. He despises all those of us who are pro-European, and that’s another reason he despises university students – because they booed him for trying to keep them out of the EU. That’s why he’s turning this general election into a No vote for Europe and hoping that we’re fool enough not to notice.
Evarist the democrat
Evarist Bartolo said on BondiPlus that we shouldn’t be afraid Labour will take us out of Europe. With that expression of outraged honour that he likes to wear – when he’s not wearing the one that says ‘I’m an intellectual and you’re not’ – he turned to the prime minister and said: ‘At our party’s general conference in 2001, we decided that if people vote for EU membership in the 2003 general election, we will respect their decision.’
Ar’hemm hej. Allahares le, as my grandmother would say. How did they structure the question for that vote, I wonder: will we or won’t we respect the people’s verdict in the 2003 general election? Then they vote to respect the people’s decision and applaud themselves for being democratic. What are these people, and which part of what deeply secluded jungle did they come from?
You will notice that Bartolo made no mention of the referendum that lay up ahead when he and his party folk took that landmark vote for democracy at the 2001 general conference. The Iva/Le campaign was already up and running, but they were pretending that no referendum was going to happen. We forget just how bad Sant really is: while Malta was gearing up for a referendum vote, he was gearing up to pretend that it never happened (except for that brief moment when partnership won and he was drunk on a lorry with his tie askew, wondering what fate now held in store for him).
VAT on school ties and 5% off an atlas
I want to rush at the television screen and give that Evarist Bartolo a good shake when I hear him speaking about things that he can’t possibly believe in. The man wasn’t born without a brain, and he knows how to maximise his advantages. For example, he fought against EU membership in the trenches at his friend Sant’s side, but I knew he couldn’t possibly dislike the idea. Then, when his super-intelligent high-achieving daughter (a really smart girl) won a place at Cambridge, he was able to take advantage of EU membership and the fact that he doesn’t have to pay the crippling fees that apply to non-EU citizens.
You have to hand it to Labour. They really know how to work the very system they pretended to fight against to keep the irascible Sant happy. Some of the party’s keenest front-line anti-EU fighters were the first to stick their noses into the European Commission trough.
So why did I want to give Bartolo a good shake this time? It was when I heard him defend Sant’s nutty proposal about what he claims is VAT on education. Not only is there no VAT on education, but education itself is completely free for those who need it like that, paid for mainly out of other people’s taxes. How do you slap VAT on something for which you pay nothing?
The Labour Party thinks very little of its supporters if it thinks they’ll swallow this. But apparently, some of them do. I watched Claudette Baldacchino interviewing them at a mass meeting the other week and they were all saying how good this measure will be because VAT on education is almost forcing them to go out and beg on the streets.
Lou Bondi pointed out to Bartolo that the Labour Party defines ‘VAT on education’ as VAT on school ties, atlases, schoolbooks (the VAT on any sort of book is a measly 5%), computers, software, desks, stationery, pens, satchels, shoes, uniforms – with children, the list is endless. As Bondi remarked, what’s to stop parents buying assorted desks and pieces of furniture or computers for themselves, and then claiming them as educational items under Labour’s whacky policy?
Bartolo wasn’t amused. He put on his expression of outraged honour again. How dare Bondi criticise Sant’s policy? ‘You’d better be careful,’ he warned him in that Labour voice, ‘or we’ll know for sure that what people say about you is true.’
‘What do people say about me that’s true?’ Bondi asked. And Bartolo replied, ‘They call your show GonziPlus.’ Oooooooh – harsh one, Ev. You really have to hand it to these Labour big cheeses: the ability to crack a good joke is not their strong point.
For those of you who are curious about this Amazing Plan for VAT Off Education, this is how it works. Bartolo explained it. They’ll get into government and then they’ll see. Just like with the surcharge. And just like when they removed VAT and found themselves reinventing the tax wheel.
They do have a vague outline, though: parents will collect all the receipts for every single pen, pencil, school tie, atlas and blank CD they buy. Then every couple of months they’ll send these mountains of receipts off to a special VAT-Off-Education Department, where a thousand little elves will be employed to sort through the thumbed and well-worn detritus and check each little stub carefully for cheating. Then they’ll them up, work out the VAT element in each total, check the parents’ details, and work out a VAT refund to be allocated along with the children’s allowance.
Practical, isn’t it? Just like all Labour’s stupid gimmicks, it doesn’t make sense (why are we not surprised, when the person who comes up with them doesn’t make any sense either?). Wouldn’t it be cheaper and cost far less in man-hours to just slap on a straightforward increase in the children’s allowance cheque?
Ah, but no – that doesn’t have the right ring of a gimmick about it. VAT-Off-Education (when education is free) sounds a whole lot better than Vote for Us and Get Another €100 of children’s allowance every year. Telenovela Sant is at it again.
Labour strikes oil
I’m still waiting for the moment in this election campaign when Labour United produces a giant geological map and tells us that its secret oil-rigs have struck liquid gold.
Under yet another tent, this time in Senglea, Sant gave us his word that he will strike oil when elected prime minister (‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’).
He most certainly is hoping he will, because it’s the only chance he’s got of solving the problem he’s landed his party with before they’ve even got into government. Lino Spiteri must be wiping the sweat off his brow with relief that none of this is ever going to be his responsibility.
You see, Sant is still sticking to his guns about halving the electricity surcharge for families (the European Commission won’t let him halve it for businesses, as that counts as state aid), even as the price of oil hit €103 a barrel in the last couple of days. When he first made his reckless commitment, oil cost €89 a barrel. In the mere course of this electoral campaign, the cost to the taxpayer of Sant’s opportunistic electioneering promise has soared by millions of euros.
Where’s he going to get that money? Don’t look around the room, because there’s nobody else there but you.
Being positive hurts them in the guts
The prime minister and Evarist Bartolo were asked to give just one final sentence each to wrap up that edition of BondiPlus. Well, what do you know? Bartolo stuck to the grand old Labour tradition of manipulating negative sentiments. ‘If you have always voted PN and are fed up of this government, come to us. Vote Labour,’ he said.
Classy act, our Ev – he would use his last TVM comment before the general election to address the disgruntled Nationalist vote, instead of filling us with hope and inspiration at the wonders of a new Labour government.
Come over to the Dark Side. Darth Vader is waiting for you.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  

  
I have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.
Watch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.
And this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.
The Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.
This is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.
Jeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition
By that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’
And then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’
Sant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.
He had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.
Sant calls the police
When he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.
The days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant
Pullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.
My mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.
He had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’
I was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.
Alfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.
As he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.
Just as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.
I’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.
  

  
They told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.
It looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.
Two weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.
Chicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess
The television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.
Highly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.
Super One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.
Wig glued on tight
It didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.
Paired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.
Massing for war
I didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.
There wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.
Had Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.
Jo Said wants a bodyguard
Last week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.
Said copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’
That evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.
‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’
So Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.
And now here’s Jo Said again
Did you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.
Today I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.
In this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’
Fascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.
You know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.
  

  
I’ve just finished watching BondiPlus. It turns out that just before Labour made such a great fuss about the Safi supermarket permit resignations at the MEPA (the project is one of Charles Polidano’s), Labour’s Lion of Change was seen eating lunch with Ic-Caqnu himself – his guest at the Le Meridien in St Julian’s. I wonder what he chose off the menu – half an ox, probably.
You can’t do anything on this island, can you?
And so the lovely Rachel Attard found out and confronted the unlovely Alfred Sant under one of his many tents. Sant answered her with the question we have all come to expect from him now, ‘Ghaliex le?’ I’ll put the rest of his reply in English, to save my having to translate for our international viewers: ‘If they were eating together, I hope it was a nice meal in an informal context. Can’t one person eat with another?’
Apparently not, because when Sant’s stork-like sidekick Charlon Gouder found a years-old photograph of Jesmond Mugliett having dinner with the architect Robert Sant – who is now working on the infamous bridge – he stalked the prime minister with it in his hands for days. You have to hand it to Charlon: he’s a single-issue man. His obsessions verge on perversion.
So let’s see now – why would the Lion of Change have been lunching a deux with Charles Polidano, one of the barons that Labour dislikes so much, saying that he gets whatever he wants from this government? Perhaps the Lion of Change was dispatched to secure a donation for his party’s coffers. We know that Labour are such bad financial managers that they’re always broke. They pay their people peanuts, and when I won a libel suit against them, and they had to pay me around Lm600 (Joseph Muscat was required to pay another Lm600), my lawyer ended up having to place a warrant of seizure on all their bank accounts – and still we just couldn’t find that Lm600. I had to call Jason Micallef and threaten to send in the bailiffs for Alfred Sant’s desk and computer and finally I got a cheque in the mail.
That’s Labour for you. Then they want to tell this government how to make the economy grow by 4% (when it’s growing by 4% already – oh sorry, that was a misprint; we meant 6%).
Watch your tongue, Gunther Verheugen
Gunther Verheugen put in an appearance in the 2003 general election, reminding us that what the Nationalist Party says about Europe isn’t spin but fact. It seems that the people of Malta won’t believe their own prime minister and must have outside confirmation. Needs must when the devil drives.
Now here’s Verheugen again, interviewed via satellite link for BondiPlus, telling us that what Sant says he’s going to do isn’t ‘legally possible’, and even if he were to attempt the impossible and try, he’s going to have to knock on 26 prime ministerial doors and make his case to each and every one of them. That’s something that has never happened before, Verheugen said.
Sant wasn’t on the show to say that he’d bite off his long tongue, like he did last time, but his old friend Evarist Bartolo was, as slimy, snake-like and underhand as ever. And what is this problem that Labour people have with heckling the prime ministers they don’t agree with? My abiding memory of the 2003 general election is of Sant heckling Fenech Adami in that washerwoman’s voice he uses when he’s cross, even as the credits rolled in the last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign.
Now here was Evarist Bartolo, talking over the prime minister and interrupting him, not letting him say that the reason Malta is in the Eurozone in the first place is because Sant is wrong about Malta being in a financial mess. You can’t be in a financial mess when you enter the Eurozone. It’s not allowed. If Gonzi were of the washerwoman frame of mind, like Bartolo is despite pretending to be an intellectual like Sant, he might have said: ‘The Labour Party would know all about finances that are in a mess, wouldn’t it?’ But he’s not that kind of man, and that’s why people prefer him to The Other One.
Gonzi coins a slogan for Labour
‘Aghzel Labour ghax ihammeg’ – a sort of reverse washing-powder, perhaps. Throw a dash of Labour in your washing-machine and your laundry comes out dirty and stinking.
I have a theory about Sant and the EU
He keeps repeating that the referendum result counted for nothing in his book, that he has no regrets about his stance on EU membership, and that the only verdict he rates is the verdict in a general election.
Now he lists the various fights he intends to pick with the European Union. He also has one of those dreadfully incapacitating mindsets that allows for no revision of a fixed view. People miss this fact because on other matters, Sant chops and changes as he goes along, all in the interests of opportunism. But those are minor issues as far as he’s concerned. On his major, life-defining issue of EU membership for Malta, he hasn’t changed his tune for 40 years, and he isn’t going to.
So, taking all these factors and clues into consideration, this is what he’s revving up to do. First he makes it plain that he’s still Eurosceptic and that he plans to ‘renegotiate’ with Europe. That way, we are forewarned of his intentions, and if we elect him prime minister, he will consider himself as having a mandate to press forward with his Eurosceptic approach and his attempts at renegotiation.
When his renegotiation attempts fail at the first hurdle, he’ll begin trying to pull us away from, and ultimately out of, the European Union. Because he doesn’t believe in referendums, but only in general elections, he won’t even ask us for our opinion. We can march and mass and protest in streets and squares as we did in the 1980s, and he’ll just ignore us and tell us that the result of a general election is what counts, and we voted for him to renegotiate with Europe.
Gonzi keeps asking why there is nothing in Labour’s electoral programme about what they plan to do with the €855 million in funds that will come in from the EU. Well, that’s the reason why. Sant’s plan is to have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU, still less with its funds. It’s dirty money to him. Show him a bunch of euros, and he recoils. I haven’t heard him say the word ‘euro’ once in this entire campaign.
If he has his way, there’ll be no funds to bother about because there’ll be no EU membership to bother about either.
He still hasn’t forgiven us for voting Yes in that referendum. He really can’t stand us for doing it. He despises all those of us who are pro-European, and that’s another reason he despises university students – because they booed him for trying to keep them out of the EU. That’s why he’s turning this general election into a No vote for Europe and hoping that we’re fool enough not to notice.
Evarist the democrat
Evarist Bartolo said on BondiPlus that we shouldn’t be afraid Labour will take us out of Europe. With that expression of outraged honour that he likes to wear – when he’s not wearing the one that says ‘I’m an intellectual and you’re not’ – he turned to the prime minister and said: ‘At our party’s general conference in 2001, we decided that if people vote for EU membership in the 2003 general election, we will respect their decision.’
Ar’hemm hej. Allahares le, as my grandmother would say. How did they structure the question for that vote, I wonder: will we or won’t we respect the people’s verdict in the 2003 general election? Then they vote to respect the people’s decision and applaud themselves for being democratic. What are these people, and which part of what deeply secluded jungle did they come from?
You will notice that Bartolo made no mention of the referendum that lay up ahead when he and his party folk took that landmark vote for democracy at the 2001 general conference. The Iva/Le campaign was already up and running, but they were pretending that no referendum was going to happen. We forget just how bad Sant really is: while Malta was gearing up for a referendum vote, he was gearing up to pretend that it never happened (except for that brief moment when partnership won and he was drunk on a lorry with his tie askew, wondering what fate now held in store for him).
VAT on school ties and 5% off an atlas
I want to rush at the television screen and give that Evarist Bartolo a good shake when I hear him speaking about things that he can’t possibly believe in. The man wasn’t born without a brain, and he knows how to maximise his advantages. For example, he fought against EU membership in the trenches at his friend Sant’s side, but I knew he couldn’t possibly dislike the idea. Then, when his super-intelligent high-achieving daughter (a really smart girl) won a place at Cambridge, he was able to take advantage of EU membership and the fact that he doesn’t have to pay the crippling fees that apply to non-EU citizens.
You have to hand it to Labour. They really know how to work the very system they pretended to fight against to keep the irascible Sant happy. Some of the party’s keenest front-line anti-EU fighters were the first to stick their noses into the European Commission trough.
So why did I want to give Bartolo a good shake this time? It was when I heard him defend Sant’s nutty proposal about what he claims is VAT on education. Not only is there no VAT on education, but education itself is completely free for those who need it like that, paid for mainly out of other people’s taxes. How do you slap VAT on something for which you pay nothing?
The Labour Party thinks very little of its supporters if it thinks they’ll swallow this. But apparently, some of them do. I watched Claudette Baldacchino interviewing them at a mass meeting the other week and they were all saying how good this measure will be because VAT on education is almost forcing them to go out and beg on the streets.
Lou Bondi pointed out to Bartolo that the Labour Party defines ‘VAT on education’ as VAT on school ties, atlases, schoolbooks (the VAT on any sort of book is a measly 5%), computers, software, desks, stationery, pens, satchels, shoes, uniforms – with children, the list is endless. As Bondi remarked, what’s to stop parents buying assorted desks and pieces of furniture or computers for themselves, and then claiming them as educational items under Labour’s whacky policy?
Bartolo wasn’t amused. He put on his expression of outraged honour again. How dare Bondi criticise Sant’s policy? ‘You’d better be careful,’ he warned him in that Labour voice, ‘or we’ll know for sure that what people say about you is true.’
‘What do people say about me that’s true?’ Bondi asked. And Bartolo replied, ‘They call your show GonziPlus.’ Oooooooh – harsh one, Ev. You really have to hand it to these Labour big cheeses: the ability to crack a good joke is not their strong point.
For those of you who are curious about this Amazing Plan for VAT Off Education, this is how it works. Bartolo explained it. They’ll get into government and then they’ll see. Just like with the surcharge. And just like when they removed VAT and found themselves reinventing the tax wheel.
They do have a vague outline, though: parents will collect all the receipts for every single pen, pencil, school tie, atlas and blank CD they buy. Then every couple of months they’ll send these mountains of receipts off to a special VAT-Off-Education Department, where a thousand little elves will be employed to sort through the thumbed and well-worn detritus and check each little stub carefully for cheating. Then they’ll them up, work out the VAT element in each total, check the parents’ details, and work out a VAT refund to be allocated along with the children’s allowance.
Practical, isn’t it? Just like all Labour’s stupid gimmicks, it doesn’t make sense (why are we not surprised, when the person who comes up with them doesn’t make any sense either?). Wouldn’t it be cheaper and cost far less in man-hours to just slap on a straightforward increase in the children’s allowance cheque?
Ah, but no – that doesn’t have the right ring of a gimmick about it. VAT-Off-Education (when education is free) sounds a whole lot better than Vote for Us and Get Another €100 of children’s allowance every year. Telenovela Sant is at it again.
Labour strikes oil
I’m still waiting for the moment in this election campaign when Labour United produces a giant geological map and tells us that its secret oil-rigs have struck liquid gold.
Under yet another tent, this time in Senglea, Sant gave us his word that he will strike oil when elected prime minister (‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’).
He most certainly is hoping he will, because it’s the only chance he’s got of solving the problem he’s landed his party with before they’ve even got into government. Lino Spiteri must be wiping the sweat off his brow with relief that none of this is ever going to be his responsibility.
You see, Sant is still sticking to his guns about halving the electricity surcharge for families (the European Commission won’t let him halve it for businesses, as that counts as state aid), even as the price of oil hit €103 a barrel in the last couple of days. When he first made his reckless commitment, oil cost €89 a barrel. In the mere course of this electoral campaign, the cost to the taxpayer of Sant’s opportunistic electioneering promise has soared by millions of euros.
Where’s he going to get that money? Don’t look around the room, because there’s nobody else there but you.
Being positive hurts them in the guts
The prime minister and Evarist Bartolo were asked to give just one final sentence each to wrap up that edition of BondiPlus. Well, what do you know? Bartolo stuck to the grand old Labour tradition of manipulating negative sentiments. ‘If you have always voted PN and are fed up of this government, come to us. Vote Labour,’ he said.
Classy act, our Ev – he would use his last TVM comment before the general election to address the disgruntled Nationalist vote, instead of filling us with hope and inspiration at the wonders of a new Labour government.
Come over to the Dark Side. Darth Vader is waiting for you.
  

  
If the Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando case was really that scandalous, then how come AD didn’t know anything about it? Carmel Cacopardo must have fallen asleep on the night-watch. Too bad Jo Said didn’t jump out at him from a bush to yell ‘Corruption!’ in his ear.
Now here comes Harry Vassallo, to join forces with his sole remaining potential coalition partner, Alfred Sant. Vassallo called this ‘the obscene Mistra case’. Go back to sleep, Vassallo – or to borrow a choice phrase from my youngest son, just eff off until you get your priorities right.
This campaign has been littered with Labour’s hideous obscenities, and finally Vassallo wakes up from the land of nod and calls something obscene – only it’s not the way that Sant behaved in this case and others. Oh, no – it’s the way a third party put in an application for development on Pullicino Orlando’s land.
Vassallo should have a little consultation with Cacopardo, a man who seriously needs to have his eyebrows trimmed because they’re taking over the whole show. Tenants apply to the MEPA for permission to develop their landlord’s property all the time. They are supposed to inform the landlord and seek his permission, but they don’t and the MEPA never checks. I live in a green area, all of it agricultural land which is owned by the Joint Office (church-government), and you can bet that when any one of the tenant-farmers wants to build a room for his tools or a rubble wall, dig a reservoir or an artesian well, or put down a cement road for his truck, it’s not the Joint Office that puts in the application. The Joint Office probably doesn’t even know what’s going on.
And this throws up some very interesting scenarios. Let’s say that when Alfred Sant is prime minister, somebody who pays rent to the Joint Office for a stretch of land decides to apply to the MEPA for permission to build an open-air nightclub or even a pizza parlour. The Joint Office is not informed. What are we expected to do, then – stand outside the Archbishop’s Curia and the Auberge de Castille to shout ‘korruzjoni’? Maybe Harry Vassallo will come out of the woodwork to call Archbishop Cremona and Prime Minister Sant ‘obscene’.
AD the watchdog
I can’t believe that the AD people are still at it, ranting on about coalitions until the 11th hour. Claire Bonello has colonised the Internet forums to tell people that a seat in a coalition government for AD is crucial because that way, AD can be the people’s watchdog.
What? The people’s watchdog when the people didn’t vote for AD? How presumptuous and self-important these people are. They don’t even begin to realise how arrogant they sound: 3000 people vote them in to parliament and suddenly they’re the nation’s watchdog. I don’t see Rita Law saying she’s the national watchdog just because she has more votes than AD.
Bonello didn’t have a ready reply when somebody asked her, ‘In that case, if AD is going to watch the government, who is going to watch AD?’ Because all of its people are as pure as the driven snow, AD has the divine right to govern unchecked.
Well, I have news for you. Nobody’s perfect.
Harry the rent-law campaigner is a protected tenant
On The Times Internet forum, I have been challenging AD for days to come forward with their much-trumpeted honesty and declare that none of its leading protagonists is a protected tenant. As soon as I post that kind of comment, AD’s input into the debate goes dead silent.
They know that I know exactly which one of them is a protected tenant, and they also know why I’m asking. And like Alfred Sant, they’re too chicken to say, because it kind of undermines their relentless rent-law campaigning on behalf of landlords, if the news gets out that Saint Harry Vassallo is a protected tenant himself and won’t return the keys.
Yes, he has offices in Valletta which he never uses because he hasn’t worked as a lawyer for years. The offices belong to somebody else and he pays a peppercorn rent every year. The owners have been asking him for a long time for the return of the keys and what’s rightfully theirs. They have to listen to Harry Vassallo rant on about the unfairness of our rent laws while knowing that he’s exploiting the system to suit himself.
When Vassallo began his rent law reform campaign, they thought their moment had come. Through their lawyer they asked Vassallo to be a gentleman, stand by what he preaches, and return their property to them. Vassallo’s response was a hysterical outburst in a telephone call to the lawyer, complete with lovely threats.
I am familiar with those hysterical outbursts because I have seen a few of them at MEPA public hearings. They’re one of the reasons why I think of Vassallo as a latter-day Savonarola – all that screeching denunciation of others. It’s just too much.
So Harry Vassallo the campaigner for landlords is still a protected tenant. My husband wrote a letter about this to Malta Today, and because Malta Today appears to have become part of the MLPAD coalition, it wasn’t published. Never mind – his wife has a blog that’s had 9,500 hits in just 12 hours (and a newspaper column for good measure), so Harry’s little secret is out.
He’s got a right to be a protected tenant
Of course he has. That’s exactly what he’s campaigning against: the fact that the law allows people like him to hang on to other people’s property, even when they’re not using it, while paying peanuts.
When this subject came up at a social gathering recently, an AD supporter defended him by saying, ‘Don’t blame Harry. Blame the law. As long as the law says he should keep it, then he can. That’s why he’s campaigning to change the law.’ Excuse me, but how does that work, exactly? The law allows Vassallo to keep the property, but it does not oblige him to do so. He is free to hand the keys back to the legal owner of the place, and because this is the main tenet of his rent law reform campaign, he should set an example immediately by doing so.
But he doesn’t, because we’re all human. Savonarola has feet of clay, after all.
Jason il-pilastru ta’ Sant
Jason Micallef, armed with his vacuous smile even in the most serious of situations, and wearing the expression that says “Everything that goes in from my left ear comes straight out of my right’, huddles up to Sant rather too cosily. On Super One yesterday afternoon, when they sat behind that silly desk trying to explain to the nation why Sant walked out of the PBS studios to avoid nasty Jeffrey, they were shoved right up together, leaning in to each other with their shoulders touching. What purpose does Micallef serve, exactly – literally that of moral support? Would Sant have slid right under the desk without Micallef propping him up?
If Sant feels the need to have a dog around, now that his poodle has been long gone in Brussels, he should get a real one. I can recommend Staffordshire bull terriers. They hug up against their owners and keep nasty journalists and angry MPs away. Oh, and they have a brain.
Batman and Robin visit Kennedy Grove
In the final week of the electoral campaign, Batman and Robin are finding nothing better to do than trail around local beauty spots to tell us how malandati they are. First they went to Buskett. Now they’ve gone to Kennedy Grove.
I watched them wandering like a funeral procession around the scene of so many of my childhood picnics. It seemed like a violation. I’ll never be able to remember butterflies again. Now all I can think about when I see the Kennedy Memorial is those grim-faced crows.
‘What on earth are they doing trailing around Kennedy Grove in the last few days of the campaign, instead of explaining to us what they plan to do when in government?’ I muttered to myself on the sofa. Somebody overheard me. ‘Maybe they’ve run out of mud and have gone to pick up supplies,’ he said. ‘After 16 years of mudslinging, they must have run out.’
Somebody else chimed in – ‘Maybe Jason Micallef has been stealing his boss’s supply of mud to use as a face-pack.’ Well, I don’t know about that. He had very deep black circles round his eyes the last time I looked at him. Someone isn’t sleeping.
Sant’s whistleblowers
AD has another rant to share with the MLP: the need for a Whistleblower Act. Sant has found a convenient excuse as to why he won’t release his remaining bits of ammunition, and it’s not that his machine-gun has malfunctioned.
He can’t release this information, he said at his mass meeting, because the people who passed it on to him have changed their minds and said that they feel their livelihoods might be imperilled. Well, what can I say – at least it’s only their livelihoods and not their lives as it would have been when Sant was president of the MLP. Why do I think that this just sounds like a very convenient excuse?
If Sant’s informants in the Pullicino Orlando case and others like them were really whistleblowers in the true sense of the word, they would not have waited until the 11th hour in an election campaign, when they sense that Sant will be the next prime minister, to blow their pathetic little whistles. All this tells me is that they’re trying to curry favour with the next administration and holding out for promotion and a little bit of favouritism. I give you this information and you give me a leg-up.
No Whistleblower Act should ever be used to protect nasty specimens like this, who are only in it for what they can get out of it, and who are certainly not thinking of what’s right or of the national interest.
Labour – a slick and professional outfit
You know how the Nationalist Party raised around €500,000 during a fund-raising marathon on NET TV the Saturday before last? Well, the Labour Party felt it had to go one better, and held a fund-raising marathon on Super One the next day. When I switched on the television to take a look late in the evening, the figure hovered at just over €100,000 and the hosts looked a bit down-in-the-mouth.
They’d realised too late that they had made a serious misprint: holding a fund-raising marathon on television while their entire television audience was standing on the Floriana Granaries shouting and waving MLP flags. God, how I laughed: another misprint from Labour; another computer malfunction.
I bet it was Jason Micallef and the Lion of Change who dreamt that one up. I’d like to see them trying to slash the deficit to nothing and keep unemployment down if they can’t even work out something like this: that you don’t put on a television fund-raiser while all your donors are at the biggest mass meeting ever.
Then they tried to Tippex over this misprint by saying that the Labour Party is il-partit taz-zghir who can’t afford to give donations (and of course, the nasty government has taken all their money anyway) and not il-partit tal-baruni like Joe Saliba’s gang. Maybe the Nationalist Party just has common sense and strong organisational skills, and they don’t.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  

  
I have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.
Watch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.
And this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.
The Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.
This is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.
Jeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition
By that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’
And then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’
Sant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.
He had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.
Sant calls the police
When he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.
The days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant
Pullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.
My mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.
He had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’
I was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.
Alfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.
As he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.
Just as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.
I’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.
  

  
They told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.
It looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.
Two weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.
Chicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess
The television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.
Highly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.
Super One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.
Wig glued on tight
It didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.
Paired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.
Massing for war
I didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.
There wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.
Had Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.
Jo Said wants a bodyguard
Last week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.
Said copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’
That evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.
‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’
So Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.
And now here’s Jo Said again
Did you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.
Today I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.
In this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’
Fascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.
You know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.
  

  
I’ve just finished watching BondiPlus. It turns out that just before Labour made such a great fuss about the Safi supermarket permit resignations at the MEPA (the project is one of Charles Polidano’s), Labour’s Lion of Change was seen eating lunch with Ic-Caqnu himself – his guest at the Le Meridien in St Julian’s. I wonder what he chose off the menu – half an ox, probably.
You can’t do anything on this island, can you?
And so the lovely Rachel Attard found out and confronted the unlovely Alfred Sant under one of his many tents. Sant answered her with the question we have all come to expect from him now, ‘Ghaliex le?’ I’ll put the rest of his reply in English, to save my having to translate for our international viewers: ‘If they were eating together, I hope it was a nice meal in an informal context. Can’t one person eat with another?’
Apparently not, because when Sant’s stork-like sidekick Charlon Gouder found a years-old photograph of Jesmond Mugliett having dinner with the architect Robert Sant – who is now working on the infamous bridge – he stalked the prime minister with it in his hands for days. You have to hand it to Charlon: he’s a single-issue man. His obsessions verge on perversion.
So let’s see now – why would the Lion of Change have been lunching a deux with Charles Polidano, one of the barons that Labour dislikes so much, saying that he gets whatever he wants from this government? Perhaps the Lion of Change was dispatched to secure a donation for his party’s coffers. We know that Labour are such bad financial managers that they’re always broke. They pay their people peanuts, and when I won a libel suit against them, and they had to pay me around Lm600 (Joseph Muscat was required to pay another Lm600), my lawyer ended up having to place a warrant of seizure on all their bank accounts – and still we just couldn’t find that Lm600. I had to call Jason Micallef and threaten to send in the bailiffs for Alfred Sant’s desk and computer and finally I got a cheque in the mail.
That’s Labour for you. Then they want to tell this government how to make the economy grow by 4% (when it’s growing by 4% already – oh sorry, that was a misprint; we meant 6%).
Watch your tongue, Gunther Verheugen
Gunther Verheugen put in an appearance in the 2003 general election, reminding us that what the Nationalist Party says about Europe isn’t spin but fact. It seems that the people of Malta won’t believe their own prime minister and must have outside confirmation. Needs must when the devil drives.
Now here’s Verheugen again, interviewed via satellite link for BondiPlus, telling us that what Sant says he’s going to do isn’t ‘legally possible’, and even if he were to attempt the impossible and try, he’s going to have to knock on 26 prime ministerial doors and make his case to each and every one of them. That’s something that has never happened before, Verheugen said.
Sant wasn’t on the show to say that he’d bite off his long tongue, like he did last time, but his old friend Evarist Bartolo was, as slimy, snake-like and underhand as ever. And what is this problem that Labour people have with heckling the prime ministers they don’t agree with? My abiding memory of the 2003 general election is of Sant heckling Fenech Adami in that washerwoman’s voice he uses when he’s cross, even as the credits rolled in the last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign.
Now here was Evarist Bartolo, talking over the prime minister and interrupting him, not letting him say that the reason Malta is in the Eurozone in the first place is because Sant is wrong about Malta being in a financial mess. You can’t be in a financial mess when you enter the Eurozone. It’s not allowed. If Gonzi were of the washerwoman frame of mind, like Bartolo is despite pretending to be an intellectual like Sant, he might have said: ‘The Labour Party would know all about finances that are in a mess, wouldn’t it?’ But he’s not that kind of man, and that’s why people prefer him to The Other One.
Gonzi coins a slogan for Labour
‘Aghzel Labour ghax ihammeg’ – a sort of reverse washing-powder, perhaps. Throw a dash of Labour in your washing-machine and your laundry comes out dirty and stinking.
I have a theory about Sant and the EU
He keeps repeating that the referendum result counted for nothing in his book, that he has no regrets about his stance on EU membership, and that the only verdict he rates is the verdict in a general election.
Now he lists the various fights he intends to pick with the European Union. He also has one of those dreadfully incapacitating mindsets that allows for no revision of a fixed view. People miss this fact because on other matters, Sant chops and changes as he goes along, all in the interests of opportunism. But those are minor issues as far as he’s concerned. On his major, life-defining issue of EU membership for Malta, he hasn’t changed his tune for 40 years, and he isn’t going to.
So, taking all these factors and clues into consideration, this is what he’s revving up to do. First he makes it plain that he’s still Eurosceptic and that he plans to ‘renegotiate’ with Europe. That way, we are forewarned of his intentions, and if we elect him prime minister, he will consider himself as having a mandate to press forward with his Eurosceptic approach and his attempts at renegotiation.
When his renegotiation attempts fail at the first hurdle, he’ll begin trying to pull us away from, and ultimately out of, the European Union. Because he doesn’t believe in referendums, but only in general elections, he won’t even ask us for our opinion. We can march and mass and protest in streets and squares as we did in the 1980s, and he’ll just ignore us and tell us that the result of a general election is what counts, and we voted for him to renegotiate with Europe.
Gonzi keeps asking why there is nothing in Labour’s electoral programme about what they plan to do with the €855 million in funds that will come in from the EU. Well, that’s the reason why. Sant’s plan is to have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU, still less with its funds. It’s dirty money to him. Show him a bunch of euros, and he recoils. I haven’t heard him say the word ‘euro’ once in this entire campaign.
If he has his way, there’ll be no funds to bother about because there’ll be no EU membership to bother about either.
He still hasn’t forgiven us for voting Yes in that referendum. He really can’t stand us for doing it. He despises all those of us who are pro-European, and that’s another reason he despises university students – because they booed him for trying to keep them out of the EU. That’s why he’s turning this general election into a No vote for Europe and hoping that we’re fool enough not to notice.
Evarist the democrat
Evarist Bartolo said on BondiPlus that we shouldn’t be afraid Labour will take us out of Europe. With that expression of outraged honour that he likes to wear – when he’s not wearing the one that says ‘I’m an intellectual and you’re not’ – he turned to the prime minister and said: ‘At our party’s general conference in 2001, we decided that if people vote for EU membership in the 2003 general election, we will respect their decision.’
Ar’hemm hej. Allahares le, as my grandmother would say. How did they structure the question for that vote, I wonder: will we or won’t we respect the people’s verdict in the 2003 general election? Then they vote to respect the people’s decision and applaud themselves for being democratic. What are these people, and which part of what deeply secluded jungle did they come from?
You will notice that Bartolo made no mention of the referendum that lay up ahead when he and his party folk took that landmark vote for democracy at the 2001 general conference. The Iva/Le campaign was already up and running, but they were pretending that no referendum was going to happen. We forget just how bad Sant really is: while Malta was gearing up for a referendum vote, he was gearing up to pretend that it never happened (except for that brief moment when partnership won and he was drunk on a lorry with his tie askew, wondering what fate now held in store for him).
VAT on school ties and 5% off an atlas
I want to rush at the television screen and give that Evarist Bartolo a good shake when I hear him speaking about things that he can’t possibly believe in. The man wasn’t born without a brain, and he knows how to maximise his advantages. For example, he fought against EU membership in the trenches at his friend Sant’s side, but I knew he couldn’t possibly dislike the idea. Then, when his super-intelligent high-achieving daughter (a really smart girl) won a place at Cambridge, he was able to take advantage of EU membership and the fact that he doesn’t have to pay the crippling fees that apply to non-EU citizens.
You have to hand it to Labour. They really know how to work the very system they pretended to fight against to keep the irascible Sant happy. Some of the party’s keenest front-line anti-EU fighters were the first to stick their noses into the European Commission trough.
So why did I want to give Bartolo a good shake this time? It was when I heard him defend Sant’s nutty proposal about what he claims is VAT on education. Not only is there no VAT on education, but education itself is completely free for those who need it like that, paid for mainly out of other people’s taxes. How do you slap VAT on something for which you pay nothing?
The Labour Party thinks very little of its supporters if it thinks they’ll swallow this. But apparently, some of them do. I watched Claudette Baldacchino interviewing them at a mass meeting the other week and they were all saying how good this measure will be because VAT on education is almost forcing them to go out and beg on the streets.
Lou Bondi pointed out to Bartolo that the Labour Party defines ‘VAT on education’ as VAT on school ties, atlases, schoolbooks (the VAT on any sort of book is a measly 5%), computers, software, desks, stationery, pens, satchels, shoes, uniforms – with children, the list is endless. As Bondi remarked, what’s to stop parents buying assorted desks and pieces of furniture or computers for themselves, and then claiming them as educational items under Labour’s whacky policy?
Bartolo wasn’t amused. He put on his expression of outraged honour again. How dare Bondi criticise Sant’s policy? ‘You’d better be careful,’ he warned him in that Labour voice, ‘or we’ll know for sure that what people say about you is true.’
‘What do people say about me that’s true?’ Bondi asked. And Bartolo replied, ‘They call your show GonziPlus.’ Oooooooh – harsh one, Ev. You really have to hand it to these Labour big cheeses: the ability to crack a good joke is not their strong point.
For those of you who are curious about this Amazing Plan for VAT Off Education, this is how it works. Bartolo explained it. They’ll get into government and then they’ll see. Just like with the surcharge. And just like when they removed VAT and found themselves reinventing the tax wheel.
They do have a vague outline, though: parents will collect all the receipts for every single pen, pencil, school tie, atlas and blank CD they buy. Then every couple of months they’ll send these mountains of receipts off to a special VAT-Off-Education Department, where a thousand little elves will be employed to sort through the thumbed and well-worn detritus and check each little stub carefully for cheating. Then they’ll them up, work out the VAT element in each total, check the parents’ details, and work out a VAT refund to be allocated along with the children’s allowance.
Practical, isn’t it? Just like all Labour’s stupid gimmicks, it doesn’t make sense (why are we not surprised, when the person who comes up with them doesn’t make any sense either?). Wouldn’t it be cheaper and cost far less in man-hours to just slap on a straightforward increase in the children’s allowance cheque?
Ah, but no – that doesn’t have the right ring of a gimmick about it. VAT-Off-Education (when education is free) sounds a whole lot better than Vote for Us and Get Another €100 of children’s allowance every year. Telenovela Sant is at it again.
Labour strikes oil
I’m still waiting for the moment in this election campaign when Labour United produces a giant geological map and tells us that its secret oil-rigs have struck liquid gold.
Under yet another tent, this time in Senglea, Sant gave us his word that he will strike oil when elected prime minister (‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’).
He most certainly is hoping he will, because it’s the only chance he’s got of solving the problem he’s landed his party with before they’ve even got into government. Lino Spiteri must be wiping the sweat off his brow with relief that none of this is ever going to be his responsibility.
You see, Sant is still sticking to his guns about halving the electricity surcharge for families (the European Commission won’t let him halve it for businesses, as that counts as state aid), even as the price of oil hit €103 a barrel in the last couple of days. When he first made his reckless commitment, oil cost €89 a barrel. In the mere course of this electoral campaign, the cost to the taxpayer of Sant’s opportunistic electioneering promise has soared by millions of euros.
Where’s he going to get that money? Don’t look around the room, because there’s nobody else there but you.
Being positive hurts them in the guts
The prime minister and Evarist Bartolo were asked to give just one final sentence each to wrap up that edition of BondiPlus. Well, what do you know? Bartolo stuck to the grand old Labour tradition of manipulating negative sentiments. ‘If you have always voted PN and are fed up of this government, come to us. Vote Labour,’ he said.
Classy act, our Ev – he would use his last TVM comment before the general election to address the disgruntled Nationalist vote, instead of filling us with hope and inspiration at the wonders of a new Labour government.
Come over to the Dark Side. Darth Vader is waiting for you.
  

  
If the Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando case was really that scandalous, then how come AD didn’t know anything about it? Carmel Cacopardo must have fallen asleep on the night-watch. Too bad Jo Said didn’t jump out at him from a bush to yell ‘Corruption!’ in his ear.
Now here comes Harry Vassallo, to join forces with his sole remaining potential coalition partner, Alfred Sant. Vassallo called this ‘the obscene Mistra case’. Go back to sleep, Vassallo – or to borrow a choice phrase from my youngest son, just eff off until you get your priorities right.
This campaign has been littered with Labour’s hideous obscenities, and finally Vassallo wakes up from the land of nod and calls something obscene – only it’s not the way that Sant behaved in this case and others. Oh, no – it’s the way a third party put in an application for development on Pullicino Orlando’s land.
Vassallo should have a little consultation with Cacopardo, a man who seriously needs to have his eyebrows trimmed because they’re taking over the whole show. Tenants apply to the MEPA for permission to develop their landlord’s property all the time. They are supposed to inform the landlord and seek his permission, but they don’t and the MEPA never checks. I live in a green area, all of it agricultural land which is owned by the Joint Office (church-government), and you can bet that when any one of the tenant-farmers wants to build a room for his tools or a rubble wall, dig a reservoir or an artesian well, or put down a cement road for his truck, it’s not the Joint Office that puts in the application. The Joint Office probably doesn’t even know what’s going on.
And this throws up some very interesting scenarios. Let’s say that when Alfred Sant is prime minister, somebody who pays rent to the Joint Office for a stretch of land decides to apply to the MEPA for permission to build an open-air nightclub or even a pizza parlour. The Joint Office is not informed. What are we expected to do, then – stand outside the Archbishop’s Curia and the Auberge de Castille to shout ‘korruzjoni’? Maybe Harry Vassallo will come out of the woodwork to call Archbishop Cremona and Prime Minister Sant ‘obscene’.
AD the watchdog
I can’t believe that the AD people are still at it, ranting on about coalitions until the 11th hour. Claire Bonello has colonised the Internet forums to tell people that a seat in a coalition government for AD is crucial because that way, AD can be the people’s watchdog.
What? The people’s watchdog when the people didn’t vote for AD? How presumptuous and self-important these people are. They don’t even begin to realise how arrogant they sound: 3000 people vote them in to parliament and suddenly they’re the nation’s watchdog. I don’t see Rita Law saying she’s the national watchdog just because she has more votes than AD.
Bonello didn’t have a ready reply when somebody asked her, ‘In that case, if AD is going to watch the government, who is going to watch AD?’ Because all of its people are as pure as the driven snow, AD has the divine right to govern unchecked.
Well, I have news for you. Nobody’s perfect.
Harry the rent-law campaigner is a protected tenant
On The Times Internet forum, I have been challenging AD for days to come forward with their much-trumpeted honesty and declare that none of its leading protagonists is a protected tenant. As soon as I post that kind of comment, AD’s input into the debate goes dead silent.
They know that I know exactly which one of them is a protected tenant, and they also know why I’m asking. And like Alfred Sant, they’re too chicken to say, because it kind of undermines their relentless rent-law campaigning on behalf of landlords, if the news gets out that Saint Harry Vassallo is a protected tenant himself and won’t return the keys.
Yes, he has offices in Valletta which he never uses because he hasn’t worked as a lawyer for years. The offices belong to somebody else and he pays a peppercorn rent every year. The owners have been asking him for a long time for the return of the keys and what’s rightfully theirs. They have to listen to Harry Vassallo rant on about the unfairness of our rent laws while knowing that he’s exploiting the system to suit himself.
When Vassallo began his rent law reform campaign, they thought their moment had come. Through their lawyer they asked Vassallo to be a gentleman, stand by what he preaches, and return their property to them. Vassallo’s response was a hysterical outburst in a telephone call to the lawyer, complete with lovely threats.
I am familiar with those hysterical outbursts because I have seen a few of them at MEPA public hearings. They’re one of the reasons why I think of Vassallo as a latter-day Savonarola – all that screeching denunciation of others. It’s just too much.
So Harry Vassallo the campaigner for landlords is still a protected tenant. My husband wrote a letter about this to Malta Today, and because Malta Today appears to have become part of the MLPAD coalition, it wasn’t published. Never mind – his wife has a blog that’s had 9,500 hits in just 12 hours (and a newspaper column for good measure), so Harry’s little secret is out.
He’s got a right to be a protected tenant
Of course he has. That’s exactly what he’s campaigning against: the fact that the law allows people like him to hang on to other people’s property, even when they’re not using it, while paying peanuts.
When this subject came up at a social gathering recently, an AD supporter defended him by saying, ‘Don’t blame Harry. Blame the law. As long as the law says he should keep it, then he can. That’s why he’s campaigning to change the law.’ Excuse me, but how does that work, exactly? The law allows Vassallo to keep the property, but it does not oblige him to do so. He is free to hand the keys back to the legal owner of the place, and because this is the main tenet of his rent law reform campaign, he should set an example immediately by doing so.
But he doesn’t, because we’re all human. Savonarola has feet of clay, after all.
Jason il-pilastru ta’ Sant
Jason Micallef, armed with his vacuous smile even in the most serious of situations, and wearing the expression that says “Everything that goes in from my left ear comes straight out of my right’, huddles up to Sant rather too cosily. On Super One yesterday afternoon, when they sat behind that silly desk trying to explain to the nation why Sant walked out of the PBS studios to avoid nasty Jeffrey, they were shoved right up together, leaning in to each other with their shoulders touching. What purpose does Micallef serve, exactly – literally that of moral support? Would Sant have slid right under the desk without Micallef propping him up?
If Sant feels the need to have a dog around, now that his poodle has been long gone in Brussels, he should get a real one. I can recommend Staffordshire bull terriers. They hug up against their owners and keep nasty journalists and angry MPs away. Oh, and they have a brain.
Batman and Robin visit Kennedy Grove
In the final week of the electoral campaign, Batman and Robin are finding nothing better to do than trail around local beauty spots to tell us how malandati they are. First they went to Buskett. Now they’ve gone to Kennedy Grove.
I watched them wandering like a funeral procession around the scene of so many of my childhood picnics. It seemed like a violation. I’ll never be able to remember butterflies again. Now all I can think about when I see the Kennedy Memorial is those grim-faced crows.
‘What on earth are they doing trailing around Kennedy Grove in the last few days of the campaign, instead of explaining to us what they plan to do when in government?’ I muttered to myself on the sofa. Somebody overheard me. ‘Maybe they’ve run out of mud and have gone to pick up supplies,’ he said. ‘After 16 years of mudslinging, they must have run out.’
Somebody else chimed in – ‘Maybe Jason Micallef has been stealing his boss’s supply of mud to use as a face-pack.’ Well, I don’t know about that. He had very deep black circles round his eyes the last time I looked at him. Someone isn’t sleeping.
Sant’s whistleblowers
AD has another rant to share with the MLP: the need for a Whistleblower Act. Sant has found a convenient excuse as to why he won’t release his remaining bits of ammunition, and it’s not that his machine-gun has malfunctioned.
He can’t release this information, he said at his mass meeting, because the people who passed it on to him have changed their minds and said that they feel their livelihoods might be imperilled. Well, what can I say – at least it’s only their livelihoods and not their lives as it would have been when Sant was president of the MLP. Why do I think that this just sounds like a very convenient excuse?
If Sant’s informants in the Pullicino Orlando case and others like them were really whistleblowers in the true sense of the word, they would not have waited until the 11th hour in an election campaign, when they sense that Sant will be the next prime minister, to blow their pathetic little whistles. All this tells me is that they’re trying to curry favour with the next administration and holding out for promotion and a little bit of favouritism. I give you this information and you give me a leg-up.
No Whistleblower Act should ever be used to protect nasty specimens like this, who are only in it for what they can get out of it, and who are certainly not thinking of what’s right or of the national interest.
Labour – a slick and professional outfit
You know how the Nationalist Party raised around €500,000 during a fund-raising marathon on NET TV the Saturday before last? Well, the Labour Party felt it had to go one better, and held a fund-raising marathon on Super One the next day. When I switched on the television to take a look late in the evening, the figure hovered at just over €100,000 and the hosts looked a bit down-in-the-mouth.
They’d realised too late that they had made a serious misprint: holding a fund-raising marathon on television while their entire television audience was standing on the Floriana Granaries shouting and waving MLP flags. God, how I laughed: another misprint from Labour; another computer malfunction.
I bet it was Jason Micallef and the Lion of Change who dreamt that one up. I’d like to see them trying to slash the deficit to nothing and keep unemployment down if they can’t even work out something like this: that you don’t put on a television fund-raiser while all your donors are at the biggest mass meeting ever.
Then they tried to Tippex over this misprint by saying that the Labour Party is il-partit taz-zghir who can’t afford to give donations (and of course, the nasty government has taken all their money anyway) and not il-partit tal-baruni like Joe Saliba’s gang. Maybe the Nationalist Party just has common sense and strong organisational skills, and they don’t.
  

  
Last Wednesday, Anglu Farrugia – former inspector in Lorry Pullicino’s force force and shadow minister for justice – rushed down to Police Headquarters and shot the Labour Party in the foot.
You may have wondered why Super One isn’t saying anything about il-kaz skandaluz ta’ korruzzjoni fahhxija fil-Freeport. Well, it’s because Farrugia isn’t the brightest bulb in Labour’s chandelier – and that’s saying something. He didn’t bother to check out the voting preference of the person in question, having assumed that anybody who has links with the Freeport must vote PN.
But as Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando revealed last Saturday, that’s not the case at all. You can be two of Sant’s shadow ministers and have links to the Freeport. You can rent flats to the Freeport for years in the name of a company, then get your wife to sign the back of the rent-cheques and cash them at the bank instead of putting them through the company account. You can do this even during the 22 months when you are sitting in Sant’s cabinet.
Bir-rispett kollu…ghaliex le? Then you can quickly make a spontaneous declaration to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, put your affairs in order, and allow Sant to say at a press conference that as far as he’s concerned, you’ve done nothing wrong.
Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? Back in 1992, when he was already leader of the Labour Party, I was working as associate editor at The Malta Independent. A hot story came in: the Labour Party leader was the anonymous Malta correspondent of The Economist Intelligence Unit, and he wasn’t declaring his earnings from that source for income tax. We checked it out, found it was true, and ran the piece with comments from a leading tax consultant. Sant is sympathetic to his shadow ministers and their Freeport flats because he’s been in their position. If he were to chastise them, they would say, ‘You’re a fine one to talk, aren’t you?’
But back to Anglu and the scandal that backfired
Anglu Farrugia told the Commissioner of Police that he knows of six people who were asked to pay between €2,700 and €2,400 to get a job at the Freeport. The former police inspector revealed with relish that he even knew the name of the person taking the backhanders: Simon Spiteri.
Now this is what I mean when I say that Farrugia isn’t the brightest bulb in the chandelier. Spiteri’s nickname is ‘it-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant’. What does that tell you about him? There, you see – even you could work it out, and I mean his political party of choice, rather than his supposed parentage.
Spiteri already has a record with the police on similar charges. A few weeks before Farrugia huffed down to his former place of work to file his report, Michael ‘Opus Dei’ Axiaq of the Nationalist Party had filed a similar report about Spiteri, involving other people whose money he had taken.
I don’t wish to repeat that bit about Farrugia’s brightness, but it should have been obvious to him that (1) Spiteri’s nickname says a lot about his voting tendencies and (2) he wasn’t taking the money in return for giving jobs at the Freeport, but taking the money and running. After I sat and mulled over this one a little – how on earth does Farrugia imagine that the Freeport human resources division relies on thugs taking money for its recruitment? –something clicked. Of course Farrugia believes this kind of thing happens, because that’s the way it happened in his day under Labour. He probably thinks that it’s still par for the course.
Farrugia wasn’t the only one who thought he had scooped a scandal
A few weeks back, Labour MP Karl Chircop and shadow tourism minister Evarist Bartolo spoke about cases they knew of in which people were asked to pay money to get a job at the Freeport. They flung their accusations around – Sant taught them well – but refused to give the Commissioner of Police any further details when he asked to have them. There was an embarrassing scene on television with, if I remember rightly, Karl Chircop, in which the interviewer pressed him to explain why he refused to tell the Commissioner of Police who was taking money from people and telling them he could get them a job at the Freeport.
Ah, now we know why he wouldn’t tell. Unlike Anglu Farrugia, he knows the significance of the nickname ‘it-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant’. I can’t imagine that a news clip which begins ‘Simon Spiteri, maghruf bhala t-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant, huwa akkuzat li ha flus minghand in-nies….’ would serve any possible electoral purpose for the Labour Party.
Some people will believe anything
With the Labour administration of 1971 to 1987, corruption was so rampant that there are still people around who think they can bribe their way to whatever they want or need. But really, how disengaged from reality do you have to be to hand money over to somebody who claims to be a Freeport go-between, and who promises to get you a job in return?
I suppose you have to be somebody like Anglu Farrugia. The gist of his police report wasn’t that there was a swindler about, taking money off people by making false promises. No, the gist of his report was that a certain individual was taking money in return for Freeport jobs.
Some minister of justice he’ll make.
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning, as did the Prime Minister’s More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.
He doesn’t answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?
Now we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.
A few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).
“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”
If Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.
‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.
No wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.
Ah, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.
“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”
Those of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”
On Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.
Picture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.
Bug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”
I didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.
“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.
Next to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.
Even if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.
You can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.
Labour United
When the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.
Throughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.
Bullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.
Sant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.
He lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.
I can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.
This must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.
Whichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.
Floods of tears
Alfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.
So why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.
Ironically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.
And yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.
That should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.
If he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.
So far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
AD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.
I can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.
And like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.
He’s been inside him
No, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.
Taken from one of the Internet posts
“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”
“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”
“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.
Then I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.
But AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.
So let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.
This isn’t me speaking
It’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.
”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”
  

  
This morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.
What a coward.
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).
The BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.
Ja pufta
Labour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.
Now, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.
Labour United – they’re a winning team.
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.
As Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.
He is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.
What a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.
Dearest Daphne,
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation.
I am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.
Obviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.
You are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.
Thanks again, Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)
Yes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.
  

  
I have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.
Watch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.
And this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.
The Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.
This is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.
Jeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition
By that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’
And then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’
Sant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.
He had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.
Sant calls the police
When he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.
The days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant
Pullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.
My mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.
He had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’
I was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.
Alfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.
As he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.
Just as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.
I’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.
  

  
They told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.
It looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.
Two weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.
Chicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess
The television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.
Highly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.
Super One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.
Wig glued on tight
It didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.
Paired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.
Massing for war
I didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.
There wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.
Had Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.
Jo Said wants a bodyguard
Last week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.
Said copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’
That evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.
‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’
So Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.
And now here’s Jo Said again
Did you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.
Today I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.
In this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’
Fascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.
You know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.
  

  
I’ve just finished watching BondiPlus. It turns out that just before Labour made such a great fuss about the Safi supermarket permit resignations at the MEPA (the project is one of Charles Polidano’s), Labour’s Lion of Change was seen eating lunch with Ic-Caqnu himself – his guest at the Le Meridien in St Julian’s. I wonder what he chose off the menu – half an ox, probably.
You can’t do anything on this island, can you?
And so the lovely Rachel Attard found out and confronted the unlovely Alfred Sant under one of his many tents. Sant answered her with the question we have all come to expect from him now, ‘Ghaliex le?’ I’ll put the rest of his reply in English, to save my having to translate for our international viewers: ‘If they were eating together, I hope it was a nice meal in an informal context. Can’t one person eat with another?’
Apparently not, because when Sant’s stork-like sidekick Charlon Gouder found a years-old photograph of Jesmond Mugliett having dinner with the architect Robert Sant – who is now working on the infamous bridge – he stalked the prime minister with it in his hands for days. You have to hand it to Charlon: he’s a single-issue man. His obsessions verge on perversion.
So let’s see now – why would the Lion of Change have been lunching a deux with Charles Polidano, one of the barons that Labour dislikes so much, saying that he gets whatever he wants from this government? Perhaps the Lion of Change was dispatched to secure a donation for his party’s coffers. We know that Labour are such bad financial managers that they’re always broke. They pay their people peanuts, and when I won a libel suit against them, and they had to pay me around Lm600 (Joseph Muscat was required to pay another Lm600), my lawyer ended up having to place a warrant of seizure on all their bank accounts – and still we just couldn’t find that Lm600. I had to call Jason Micallef and threaten to send in the bailiffs for Alfred Sant’s desk and computer and finally I got a cheque in the mail.
That’s Labour for you. Then they want to tell this government how to make the economy grow by 4% (when it’s growing by 4% already – oh sorry, that was a misprint; we meant 6%).
Watch your tongue, Gunther Verheugen
Gunther Verheugen put in an appearance in the 2003 general election, reminding us that what the Nationalist Party says about Europe isn’t spin but fact. It seems that the people of Malta won’t believe their own prime minister and must have outside confirmation. Needs must when the devil drives.
Now here’s Verheugen again, interviewed via satellite link for BondiPlus, telling us that what Sant says he’s going to do isn’t ‘legally possible’, and even if he were to attempt the impossible and try, he’s going to have to knock on 26 prime ministerial doors and make his case to each and every one of them. That’s something that has never happened before, Verheugen said.
Sant wasn’t on the show to say that he’d bite off his long tongue, like he did last time, but his old friend Evarist Bartolo was, as slimy, snake-like and underhand as ever. And what is this problem that Labour people have with heckling the prime ministers they don’t agree with? My abiding memory of the 2003 general election is of Sant heckling Fenech Adami in that washerwoman’s voice he uses when he’s cross, even as the credits rolled in the last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign.
Now here was Evarist Bartolo, talking over the prime minister and interrupting him, not letting him say that the reason Malta is in the Eurozone in the first place is because Sant is wrong about Malta being in a financial mess. You can’t be in a financial mess when you enter the Eurozone. It’s not allowed. If Gonzi were of the washerwoman frame of mind, like Bartolo is despite pretending to be an intellectual like Sant, he might have said: ‘The Labour Party would know all about finances that are in a mess, wouldn’t it?’ But he’s not that kind of man, and that’s why people prefer him to The Other One.
Gonzi coins a slogan for Labour
‘Aghzel Labour ghax ihammeg’ – a sort of reverse washing-powder, perhaps. Throw a dash of Labour in your washing-machine and your laundry comes out dirty and stinking.
I have a theory about Sant and the EU
He keeps repeating that the referendum result counted for nothing in his book, that he has no regrets about his stance on EU membership, and that the only verdict he rates is the verdict in a general election.
Now he lists the various fights he intends to pick with the European Union. He also has one of those dreadfully incapacitating mindsets that allows for no revision of a fixed view. People miss this fact because on other matters, Sant chops and changes as he goes along, all in the interests of opportunism. But those are minor issues as far as he’s concerned. On his major, life-defining issue of EU membership for Malta, he hasn’t changed his tune for 40 years, and he isn’t going to.
So, taking all these factors and clues into consideration, this is what he’s revving up to do. First he makes it plain that he’s still Eurosceptic and that he plans to ‘renegotiate’ with Europe. That way, we are forewarned of his intentions, and if we elect him prime minister, he will consider himself as having a mandate to press forward with his Eurosceptic approach and his attempts at renegotiation.
When his renegotiation attempts fail at the first hurdle, he’ll begin trying to pull us away from, and ultimately out of, the European Union. Because he doesn’t believe in referendums, but only in general elections, he won’t even ask us for our opinion. We can march and mass and protest in streets and squares as we did in the 1980s, and he’ll just ignore us and tell us that the result of a general election is what counts, and we voted for him to renegotiate with Europe.
Gonzi keeps asking why there is nothing in Labour’s electoral programme about what they plan to do with the €855 million in funds that will come in from the EU. Well, that’s the reason why. Sant’s plan is to have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU, still less with its funds. It’s dirty money to him. Show him a bunch of euros, and he recoils. I haven’t heard him say the word ‘euro’ once in this entire campaign.
If he has his way, there’ll be no funds to bother about because there’ll be no EU membership to bother about either.
He still hasn’t forgiven us for voting Yes in that referendum. He really can’t stand us for doing it. He despises all those of us who are pro-European, and that’s another reason he despises university students – because they booed him for trying to keep them out of the EU. That’s why he’s turning this general election into a No vote for Europe and hoping that we’re fool enough not to notice.
Evarist the democrat
Evarist Bartolo said on BondiPlus that we shouldn’t be afraid Labour will take us out of Europe. With that expression of outraged honour that he likes to wear – when he’s not wearing the one that says ‘I’m an intellectual and you’re not’ – he turned to the prime minister and said: ‘At our party’s general conference in 2001, we decided that if people vote for EU membership in the 2003 general election, we will respect their decision.’
Ar’hemm hej. Allahares le, as my grandmother would say. How did they structure the question for that vote, I wonder: will we or won’t we respect the people’s verdict in the 2003 general election? Then they vote to respect the people’s decision and applaud themselves for being democratic. What are these people, and which part of what deeply secluded jungle did they come from?
You will notice that Bartolo made no mention of the referendum that lay up ahead when he and his party folk took that landmark vote for democracy at the 2001 general conference. The Iva/Le campaign was already up and running, but they were pretending that no referendum was going to happen. We forget just how bad Sant really is: while Malta was gearing up for a referendum vote, he was gearing up to pretend that it never happened (except for that brief moment when partnership won and he was drunk on a lorry with his tie askew, wondering what fate now held in store for him).
VAT on school ties and 5% off an atlas
I want to rush at the television screen and give that Evarist Bartolo a good shake when I hear him speaking about things that he can’t possibly believe in. The man wasn’t born without a brain, and he knows how to maximise his advantages. For example, he fought against EU membership in the trenches at his friend Sant’s side, but I knew he couldn’t possibly dislike the idea. Then, when his super-intelligent high-achieving daughter (a really smart girl) won a place at Cambridge, he was able to take advantage of EU membership and the fact that he doesn’t have to pay the crippling fees that apply to non-EU citizens.
You have to hand it to Labour. They really know how to work the very system they pretended to fight against to keep the irascible Sant happy. Some of the party’s keenest front-line anti-EU fighters were the first to stick their noses into the European Commission trough.
So why did I want to give Bartolo a good shake this time? It was when I heard him defend Sant’s nutty proposal about what he claims is VAT on education. Not only is there no VAT on education, but education itself is completely free for those who need it like that, paid for mainly out of other people’s taxes. How do you slap VAT on something for which you pay nothing?
The Labour Party thinks very little of its supporters if it thinks they’ll swallow this. But apparently, some of them do. I watched Claudette Baldacchino interviewing them at a mass meeting the other week and they were all saying how good this measure will be because VAT on education is almost forcing them to go out and beg on the streets.
Lou Bondi pointed out to Bartolo that the Labour Party defines ‘VAT on education’ as VAT on school ties, atlases, schoolbooks (the VAT on any sort of book is a measly 5%), computers, software, desks, stationery, pens, satchels, shoes, uniforms – with children, the list is endless. As Bondi remarked, what’s to stop parents buying assorted desks and pieces of furniture or computers for themselves, and then claiming them as educational items under Labour’s whacky policy?
Bartolo wasn’t amused. He put on his expression of outraged honour again. How dare Bondi criticise Sant’s policy? ‘You’d better be careful,’ he warned him in that Labour voice, ‘or we’ll know for sure that what people say about you is true.’
‘What do people say about me that’s true?’ Bondi asked. And Bartolo replied, ‘They call your show GonziPlus.’ Oooooooh – harsh one, Ev. You really have to hand it to these Labour big cheeses: the ability to crack a good joke is not their strong point.
For those of you who are curious about this Amazing Plan for VAT Off Education, this is how it works. Bartolo explained it. They’ll get into government and then they’ll see. Just like with the surcharge. And just like when they removed VAT and found themselves reinventing the tax wheel.
They do have a vague outline, though: parents will collect all the receipts for every single pen, pencil, school tie, atlas and blank CD they buy. Then every couple of months they’ll send these mountains of receipts off to a special VAT-Off-Education Department, where a thousand little elves will be employed to sort through the thumbed and well-worn detritus and check each little stub carefully for cheating. Then they’ll them up, work out the VAT element in each total, check the parents’ details, and work out a VAT refund to be allocated along with the children’s allowance.
Practical, isn’t it? Just like all Labour’s stupid gimmicks, it doesn’t make sense (why are we not surprised, when the person who comes up with them doesn’t make any sense either?). Wouldn’t it be cheaper and cost far less in man-hours to just slap on a straightforward increase in the children’s allowance cheque?
Ah, but no – that doesn’t have the right ring of a gimmick about it. VAT-Off-Education (when education is free) sounds a whole lot better than Vote for Us and Get Another €100 of children’s allowance every year. Telenovela Sant is at it again.
Labour strikes oil
I’m still waiting for the moment in this election campaign when Labour United produces a giant geological map and tells us that its secret oil-rigs have struck liquid gold.
Under yet another tent, this time in Senglea, Sant gave us his word that he will strike oil when elected prime minister (‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’).
He most certainly is hoping he will, because it’s the only chance he’s got of solving the problem he’s landed his party with before they’ve even got into government. Lino Spiteri must be wiping the sweat off his brow with relief that none of this is ever going to be his responsibility.
You see, Sant is still sticking to his guns about halving the electricity surcharge for families (the European Commission won’t let him halve it for businesses, as that counts as state aid), even as the price of oil hit €103 a barrel in the last couple of days. When he first made his reckless commitment, oil cost €89 a barrel. In the mere course of this electoral campaign, the cost to the taxpayer of Sant’s opportunistic electioneering promise has soared by millions of euros.
Where’s he going to get that money? Don’t look around the room, because there’s nobody else there but you.
Being positive hurts them in the guts
The prime minister and Evarist Bartolo were asked to give just one final sentence each to wrap up that edition of BondiPlus. Well, what do you know? Bartolo stuck to the grand old Labour tradition of manipulating negative sentiments. ‘If you have always voted PN and are fed up of this government, come to us. Vote Labour,’ he said.
Classy act, our Ev – he would use his last TVM comment before the general election to address the disgruntled Nationalist vote, instead of filling us with hope and inspiration at the wonders of a new Labour government.
Come over to the Dark Side. Darth Vader is waiting for you.
  

  
If the Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando case was really that scandalous, then how come AD didn’t know anything about it? Carmel Cacopardo must have fallen asleep on the night-watch. Too bad Jo Said didn’t jump out at him from a bush to yell ‘Corruption!’ in his ear.
Now here comes Harry Vassallo, to join forces with his sole remaining potential coalition partner, Alfred Sant. Vassallo called this ‘the obscene Mistra case’. Go back to sleep, Vassallo – or to borrow a choice phrase from my youngest son, just eff off until you get your priorities right.
This campaign has been littered with Labour’s hideous obscenities, and finally Vassallo wakes up from the land of nod and calls something obscene – only it’s not the way that Sant behaved in this case and others. Oh, no – it’s the way a third party put in an application for development on Pullicino Orlando’s land.
Vassallo should have a little consultation with Cacopardo, a man who seriously needs to have his eyebrows trimmed because they’re taking over the whole show. Tenants apply to the MEPA for permission to develop their landlord’s property all the time. They are supposed to inform the landlord and seek his permission, but they don’t and the MEPA never checks. I live in a green area, all of it agricultural land which is owned by the Joint Office (church-government), and you can bet that when any one of the tenant-farmers wants to build a room for his tools or a rubble wall, dig a reservoir or an artesian well, or put down a cement road for his truck, it’s not the Joint Office that puts in the application. The Joint Office probably doesn’t even know what’s going on.
And this throws up some very interesting scenarios. Let’s say that when Alfred Sant is prime minister, somebody who pays rent to the Joint Office for a stretch of land decides to apply to the MEPA for permission to build an open-air nightclub or even a pizza parlour. The Joint Office is not informed.
