       "' \\n  \\nWhenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past, he says he’ll leave it to the historians to decide, because as far as he’s concerned it’s all water under the bridge and he has no regrets. And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour government’s corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party. When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now, the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid-1980s. And those were the days when you couldn’t report it to the Commissioner of Police, because not only was he a ‘paraventu’ for corruption in the real sense of the word, but his men were not to be trusted. Let’s say that this is some kind of act of redemption on Sant’s part – protesting too much now because he didn’t protest enough (or at all) then.\\nHe doesn’t answer hypothetical questions\\nHerman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago. He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions. Maybe that’s why, throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far, nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question: What do you plan to do if you become prime minister?\\nNow we know why he doesn’t tell us his plans. He doesn’t deal in hypotheses. So he doesn’t answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical, and he doesn’t answer questions about the past because it’s all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge. That doesn’t leave much for an interviewer to be going on with, which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewer’s least favourite subject – except for the lovely Simone Cini, that is, because she isn’t exactly out to give him a good grilling.\\nAlfred and Sir Humphrey\\nAh, but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima, who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister. For those who don’t know him, this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould. He had – still has, but he is retired now – the inscrutability of a dowager duchess’s butler and the all-perceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes, Minister. A civil servant since colonial times, he did everything with perfect correctness. You can imagine just how well he got along with ‘bazwar ‘l hawn, bazwar ‘l hemm’ Sant. Let’s just say that it wasn’t love at first sight, or at second sight either.\\nSo in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future, Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister. Interestingly, Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasn’t water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge. And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service.\\nA few days later, Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and, unshackled by the Estacode, spilt the beans on Sant in an article called – don’t you just love it – “Nothing but untruths”. I couldn’t have put it better myself. So I read on until I came to the last paragraph, which I’ll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up (The Times, 29 February).\\n“I have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range. The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates. I shall not elaborate further in that regard. His self-declared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir ‘l hemm u ftit tbazwir ‘l hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen, and to all others. It is self-evident that, with Dr Sant at the helm, Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster. In contrast, Lawrence Gonzi’s outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see. Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime minister.”\\nIf Sant owned a television set (he famously does not) he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes, Minister and learn some useful lessons, the most useful of which is this: never cross Sir Humphrey.\\nA Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols\\nIn what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country, Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30-year-old Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut, who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille.\\n‘Alfred Sant – Il-Vizjoni ghall-Bidla’ is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc tal-bidla at waiting hordes of admirers. I can’t imagine who might buy it, except people like me who want a good giggle, because it’s the most embarrassing sort of hagiography. Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung – though of course, Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce.\\nBeneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words (translated from the Maltese): “After he finished his studies in Paris, he went to America to study at the best university, Harvard, where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studied.” The English translation is deliberately clumsy, to reproduce the full effect of the original.\\nThe first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this: why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts? A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management. But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis, when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then.\\nNo wonder he makes such a hash of things, because as far as I can discern from this hagiography, he never took a refresher course.\\nAh, but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto.\\n“Alfred Sant, Il-Vizjoni Ghall-Bidla, is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti. Written by novelist Frans Sammut, it is an intimate portrait of a high-brow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change. The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa? That won the Broadcasting Authority’s TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager. His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr Sammut’s critical eye. The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained, perhaps for the first time. Dr Sant’s philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writer-politician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed details.”\\nThose of you who have been led up the garden-path by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed. There is no sex in this book.\\nLabour loves the lira\\nThe other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign. To do this, they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures. Maybe that’s why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on – for if he can’t blind us with facts and figures, what can he do? Oh, he can talk about DNA instead, or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter who’s just asked him about the Gozo incinerator, while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder: “Mur xommu.”\\nOn Super One the other day, Norman Hamilton, the shadow minister of finance, the would-be prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ‘grant’ to first-time home-buyers. Except that it’s not a grant, of course, but a loan – because if and when you sell the property, you have to pay the government back with interest. Astonishingly, they didn’t mention the word ‘euros’ once, even though you’d think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC.\\nOn the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money, he speaks about liri, for all the world as though 1 January hadn’t come and gone. Labour’s electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the party’s state of denial about the euro. The bit about subsidised loans to first-time home-buyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50,000, a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007, but which gives us the rather odd figure of €116,500 now. When explaining Labour’s house-loans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices, Sant said: “Whoever sets the price at Lm56,000 would consider selling at Lm49,000 or Lm50,000 to qualify under the scheme.”\\nThis was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good. He isn’t trying very hard to embrace the euro, now, is he?\\nNo respect\\nA front page headline in The Times read: ‘Labour will respect European Court’s ruling.’ The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief, but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place. The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things. The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party. Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists. We expect too little from Labour, and that’s precisely what we get.\\nPicking a fight with Europe\\nThe leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion, tell us that they will get the best out of Europe. Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt, of dire trepidation? Maybe it’s because I’m a shallow person, but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache. I can’t imagine the Lion of Change, fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church, his lucky santa tal-Madonna safely in his pocket, heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats.\\nPicture the same delegation that is now making pit-stop tours of villages on the kowc tal-bidla, piling onto the flight to Brussels, faces grimly and determinedly set, ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do. Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant, Alla Hares Jitilghu l-Pagi Vella and the Lion of Change. Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to describe it.\\nI remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997, when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET. He had already been in power for a year, and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT.\\nI found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semi-hysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with Malta’s taxation problem (frozen application and all, they still had to deal with the EU). The minute he found out I was Maltese, and that I didn’t like the government, he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax. It was spot on, and there I was, torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits, one of whom read out a long-winded speech at the negotiating-table.\\nBug-eyed on strong espressos, my coffee-bar acquaintance demanded of me: “Why is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient system?” I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it, and a cunning plan to replace it instead. And out came the rejoinder: “Why did your people choose such a man?”\\nI didn’t know the answer to that one. I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, and that in 1987, with all that killing, corruption, violence and fear, the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities.\\nEnoch Lowell\\nNorman Lowell, who wears a lapel-button claiming that Enoch Powell was right, is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election. So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ‘nitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his speeches, another party leader in a wig (the most recent model displaying golden-grey streaks and highlights), yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest, Emy of the Alpha Party, and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety.\\n“I’m contesting so that when we’ve been completely invaded by immigrants, this cowardly people, even though sincere, will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend them,” he explained. The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at. At least 1,600 people voted for him in the MEP elections.\\nNext to this lot of rival party leaders, Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane. I think I’ll vote for him.\\nThey continue to bore on about coalitions\\nThe Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one, whether we want to or not. What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me. Like the members of a cult, AD are working at persuading the gullible, through the use of jargon and emotive ideals, that (1) a coalition government is possible, and (2) it is desirable, rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with.\\nWhenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country, AD jumps out of the woodwork and says, but what about Germany? Yes, what indeed. Germany is now in a huge mess – as the New Left of post-GDR communists come to the fore, traditional coalitions are ruled out, leaving a swamp of uncertainty.\\nCoalitions make for extremely weak governments, and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta, where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92% of the vote. There is simply no scope for coalition here, even if those parties wanted it (and Alfred Sant, as we know, doesn’t discuss hypothetical questions). Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority.\\nThe way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party. This means that Nationalist seats in the party’s traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003, when there was a strong vote for Europe, let alone now, with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant. There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats. In this case, a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes. This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament. If a third party gets a seat, it doesn’t. Things stay as they are. This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into Sant’s lap, even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party, and we will have a rerun of 1981.\\nEven if AD doesn’t gain a seat, it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate, for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist. The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own, but as a sort of Junior PN – which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition, while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them.\\nThe result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same: the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government. So I ask: if these people don’t mind a Labour government, why don’t they just vote for it in the first place? And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister, because they prefer him to Sant, why aren’t they deploying common sense and voting for his party, instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed?\\nThis kind of behaviour reminds me of those pro-EU Labour supporters who, in 2003, voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope. It just doesn’t make sense.\\nYou can’t take AD seriously in any case, not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this: “From where I stand, having Dr Sant as prime minister in a single-party government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another single-party government” – Harry Vassallo\\nMaybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him.\\nLabour United\\nWhen the members of Alfred Sant’s shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leader’s myriad qualities and his robust strength, what they convince us of (and probably also Sant himself) is not their loyalty but their fear. Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them.\\nThroughout this election campaign, Sant has gone about as part of a huddle, not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum. Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities, he is half-buried in would-be ministers, all pressing into the camera shot. They look absolutely ridiculous, as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone – just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face.\\nPullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another, having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him. Each time, Sant was upset to see him, and fell back on some secondary subject. Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo, Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice. Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry, he launched into a tirade against him. When a reporter asked him, on camera, why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements, he just smirked.\\nBullies are cowards really, but we learned that at school. If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando, he would have no problem staring him down while saying it. It is only when we lie about people, or lie to them, that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening. Sant doesn’t want his victims shouting ‘Liar!’ from the back of the crowd, so he avoids them. “Only journalists are invited to my press conferences,” he said. Oh really? I didn’t know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra, or to approach the gates of the MEPA.\\nSant does the same with the prime minister. This morning, seemingly half-cut on his podium in Gozo, though it was so early in the day, he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldn’t give a single one. He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddy-train. Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar, but he can’t say it to his face. He’s much too lily-livered and he knows it isn’t true. The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isn’t true. Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language, the unspoken messages that come through delivery, posture and behaviour. And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when they’re being liberal with the truth, and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal.\\nThe last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders. I’d like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then. I would think that he doesn’t have what it takes. The trouble is that Sant can’t bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does, even among people who are voting Labour.\\nHe lost our trust a long time ago, and he’s not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc tal-bidla, flinging excrement at the fan.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe ugliest part of Alfred Sant’s victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far. So I am going to point it out here. Marlene Pullicino, Jeffrey’s estranged wife, is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes. They have lived apart for years, and both have formed other relationships since, but they have a daughter together.\\nI can’t imagine that the daughter, a university student, is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother. I can’t imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughter’s father, the man to whom she was married for some years, is being hunted down by her party’s giant machine in this ghastly manner. She may not like her estranged husband much any more, but surely she has some compassion for her daughter.\\nThis must mean one of four things: (1) Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughter’s sake, and he ignored her because he has no compassion; (2) Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story, and if she didn’t, she should make this clear at once; (3) Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didn’t care because she puts political ambition before her daughter’s well-being; or (4) Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ‘ammunition’ hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughter’s father, which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was.\\nWhichever way you look at it, it’s hideous. I repeat, he’s far from being an honourable man. A man like this cannot possibly command respect.\\nFloods of tears\\nAlfred Sant’s ugly cat-and-mouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged. First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando, even though it was quite obvious that he intended to, while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours, ending up in Gozo. Then, when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta, and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind, they thought of a cunning plan. Sant’s aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go. They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry. When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference, and the short notice, Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids.\\nSo why has it boomeranged? Simple – people aren’t blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions (he isn’t), he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about. He wouldn’t have run like a rat from press conference to press conference, his ‘victim’ hot on his tail, and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it. People are asking – why didn’t he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino Orlando’s face? The answer is a straightforward one: Alfred Sant, like all bullies, is a coward, and when somebody is twisting the truth about you, they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to do it with you standing right there listening.\\nIf Sant hoped that this would win him respect, it has done precisely the opposite. All he’s shown us is that he’s not much of a man, far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities.\\nIronically, his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist Party’s list has rebounded badly. If you’re going to pick on somebody, choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully. The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. Even Labour people do. So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly, nasty, unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroom’s popular charmer – not a good move. When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred Sant’s spite, it would have been a public relations master-stroke had it been planned, but it was genuine. Real tears, real anger, and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign. He enrages us, because he doesn’t behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever, coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more.\\nBooks and misprints\\nLabour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes, items that have already been carried out by this government, and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction.\\nAnd yet, at its mass meeting today, the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti – all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with: what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit. The Labour Party seems to have invested more time, money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme.\\nThat should tell you where the party’s priorities lie.\\nGonziPN is a corrupt liar\\nAt least, that’s what Alfred Sant claims. He’s said it several times over the last few days, and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology, Sant behaved like the gentleman he isn’t and rushed off to Gozo where, after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast, he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology, then GonziPN is not going to get one. Then he made the adult equivalent of a child’s playground neh-neh-neh gesture.\\nBad language\\nFirst we had Josie Muscat shouting out ‘jitnejku’ and ‘jiehduh f’ghajnhom’ in his political debates and speeches. And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium, losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesn’t want young people who live in Gozo to be ‘inkazzati’. Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister.\\nMiscellaneous fees\\nSome of the most amusing parts of Alfred Sant’s speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc tal-bidla gatherings. And so it was yesterday morning, when he pulled another health document from his top-hat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience. First he read it out in English, then he translated it into Maltese, then he put it into the simplest vernacular, like a fuddy-duddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong.\\nIf he is as smart and DBA-ed as he makes himself out to be, then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what non-British non-Maltese people pay when they use our state health services. That’s why they are miscellaneous, and not regular.\\nBut Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this, and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli weren’t exactly going to challenge him about it either.\\nCharlon Gouder\\nNow this is a man with a problem. It’s tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your pay-cheque (without proper overtime payments) is signed by a political party. But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits.\\nCharlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution. His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler, dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack, lose their temper and snap out something unwise.\\nSo far, Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man, treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew. And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday, even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration.\\nHare Krishna of Maltese politics\\nAD’s exponents have taken to calling Malta’s democratically elected governments a system of ‘single-party dictatorship’ or ‘single-party rule’. This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums don’t count and that only general elections do. Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate. Presumably, in their book, tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a ‘single-party dictatorship’ will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy.\\nI can’t help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement, repeating jargon and stock phrases: single party rule, single party dictatorship, tyranny of the oligarchy, coalition works. It’s just too tedious. Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics, springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping.\\nAnd like all cults, they just won’t let up and leave the rest of us alone. I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat.\\nHe’s been inside him\\nNo, this is not my crass choice of expression. It’s that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit, he who operated on the party leader. Interviewed on one of those Super One sofa-shows, he told his host, who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant (no surprises expected): “Jien l-uniku bniedem fid-dinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwa…hahahahahaha….u nghidilkom jien, m’hemmx hdura hemm gew.” Oh dear, too much information.\\nTaken from one of the Internet posts\\n“Alternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP. This frantic effort to assume the power-broker role in the forthcoming general election is, to say the least, nauseating. It amply shows that, indeed, AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks, whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLP.”\\n“The PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright AD’s shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit. Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population. What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II, culminating in the Prodi government of which AD’s Arnold Cassola formed part, until it was brought down due to its fractious composition.”\\n“AD should be turned down not only by the big parties, but also by the discerning electorate, who have at heart the true well-being of Malta.”\\nDivorce\\nSome people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation. I’m puzzled when I hear this. They are usually people who almost certainly have an O-level in maths, though of course, nothing in civic education because it wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) a taught subject at school. The reasoning goes something like this: a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce, and so I will vote AD.\\nThen I butt in. How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal, or is it just a symbolic protest vote? The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance. Oh, so it is a strategic vote, then. You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce. I prod a little harder. How do you think AD will be able to do this, with a single seat in parliament? Remember that AD had a seat for three years, between 1989 and 1992 (“I didn’t know that!”) and precisely nothing happened. Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour.\\nBut AD won’t just have a seat, I’m told. It will be in government. Really? How does that happen, with one seat? It will form a coalition. Who with? The Nationalist Party, of course! As if they’d form a coalition with Labour! I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasn’t ruled out coalition with Labour. Meanwhile, Labour hasn’t said what it will or won’t do because Alfred Sant doesn’t answer hypothetical questions.\\nSo let’s imagine, just for the sake of argument because in this election, as in all others, either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone, that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government. The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one. The seat ratio, in other words, is 32:1. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Party, sitting on the Opposition benches, has 32 seats. To push any of its legislation through, Labour is going to need AD’s vote (remember, this is a fantasy, because it can’t actually happen in reality). This means that AD can derail Labour’s legislation. You may think that this is good or bad – whatever. It doesn’t matter for the purpose of this argument. What does matter is this simple fact: you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats, but with one seat, you can’t. The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it. As any seasoned negotiator knows, to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered, it must have considerable leverage. The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through. Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta, and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce. In other words, it’s not going to happen. And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat, then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone, without AD playing dog-in-the-manger. And so, for that matter, can the Nationalist Party.\\nThe secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali\\nA keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube, showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona, the tall, large and policeman-shaped photographer of The Malta Independent. The strap-line reads: ‘GonziPN secret police spy on AN supporters.’\\nLots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night. “Who is this man?” the video commentary asked. “And why is he spying on us? He appears at every AN meeting, talks to nobody, takes his photograph and leaves. And God knows where those photographs end up.”\\nThey sometimes end up in The Malta Independent. Maybe AN needs a media officer.\\nAlfred Sant meets a pig\\nI happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of Sant’s last-but-one trip to Gozo. It was worth it, just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine, and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them (sensible fellow). What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister. They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper. By an extraordinary coincidence, I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island. The very same businessmen looked bright and energised, and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration. I think that says it all.\\nThis isn’t me speaking\\nIt’s a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal. I thought it was rather good.\\n”Yes, we do want change. We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party. We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election, as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats – two general elections and a referendum – and the record shortest government since Independence. Unfortunately, Dr Sant, with his 16 years of leadership, almost 30 years in the MLP, including his presidency of the party in the dark mid-1980s, his democratic gaffes like ‘partnership rebah’, his political blunders like ‘Svizzera fil-Mediterranan’, the electoral promises he failed to keep, and above all, his administrative mistakes, is not in a position to offer anything new, still less so a New Beginning. He was just never fit for the job.”\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis morning, the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonight’s political programme: Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists.\\nSant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist Party’s media. He turned white, demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there, and asked the BA representatives to have him removed. The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate, he couldn’t go on the show unless scheduled to do so, as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates.\\nPullicino Orlando stood his ground, and with the cameras rolling, challenged Sant to have the guts (not the best choice of phrase, given the nature of his recent surgery) to say what he had to say to his face. Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises. Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him. When this didn’t happen – a shame, because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strong-armed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on – Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage.\\nWhat a coward.\\nThen he shot to the friendly studios at Super One, where he feels safe on home ground, and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman, he sat grim and whey-faced behind a desk and addressed the nation, giving his reasons why he sulked. It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election, when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it (and he wouldn’t, because he still has no regrets).\\nThe BA recording was cancelled. This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight – unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats, persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media.\\nThose of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle, wait for the next NET news bulletin, or watch BondiPlus tonight. Remember that if Sant’s BA programme remains unrecorded, BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 8.30pm news on TVM.\\nJa pufta\\nLabour’s deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks, hunting and santi tal-Madonna fil-but. He’s the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania, so you can just imagine what we’re talking about here.\\nNow, to compound his hip, cool and politically correct New Labour image, the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying: ‘Kemm hu pufta u, Lou.’ That’s another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight. And of course, he had to go and say it to somebody who’s bisexual.\\nLabour United – they’re a winning team.\\nJenny Pullicino Orlando\\nThose who haven’t read Jenny Pullicino Orlando’s comment on this blog, please do so immediately. I’ve reproduced it beneath. It puts Sant’s empty words about ‘family values’ (let’s face it – he didn’t have any family values himself, did he?) into their proper perspective. Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino. The marriage broke down some years ago, but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children.\\nAs Jenny points out here, Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children. More to the point, he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate Marlene’s student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father, whom she loves and supports.\\nHe is not only a coward, but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function. To him, families are just a concept – something you read about in books as a theory.\\nWhat a despicable man. And a pathetic coward.\\nDearest Daphne,\\nThank you for shedding a human light on the situation.\\nI am now at home, unable to attend University in peace, because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions. To add insult to injury, Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook, in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt, no doubt. I call for these people to leave me alone, let me be. Let us be. I was enraged when they used your son for political gain. I was also targeted by Super One on the same day- they filmed me for a substantial amount of time, so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly.\\nObviously, using clips of me showing public disgust at Sant’s behaviour could not be used on Super One, especially once I put glasses on, which made me look all the more like my mother, a candidate for MLP. Hats off to your son for telling them off! You should honestly be proud of him. The unprecedented lows that they have reached- using children for political gain and infantile propaganda, has only attracted disgust!\\nI have made it public that I have particular political affiliations. And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right, I have defended my right to an opinion, which she has gracefully accepted. This is in no way an attack on my mother’s credibility as a politician, I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do. No, I was not informed by my mother about the situation, because she seems to not have known anything about it. No, Alfred Sant did not inform my mother. He kept it within an inner circle, ignoring the fact that his candidate’s ex-husband was going to be under fire and her daughter (a first-time voter) would, along with her father, suffer considerably for no apparent reason.\\nYou are not a man of honour, Dr.Sant. Nor are you a Hero. Nor are you capable of running a country. The ‘hamalli’ at University refused to stand by your side- and I was one of them. Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined. Non, je ne regrette rien? Well Done!\\nI hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates! Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is. I am more proud of him than I ever was.\\nThanks again, Daphne\\nHave a lovely day\\nJenny Pullicino Orlando\\n  \\n\\n  \\nA mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions, the insufferable Jason/Robin said: ‘Ibki, Jeffrey, ibki!’ (‘Cry, Jeffrey, cry!’)\\nThen when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye, Sant muttered: ‘Int m’ghandekx ghajnejn.’ (‘You have no eyes.’)\\nYes, he does, Alfred – and very nice eyes they are too.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nI have just watched the coverage of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’s showdown with the cowering Sant, and it was cathartic. I sat there applauding alone on my sofa, feeling as though Pullicino Orlando was voicing my feelings and those of thousands of others who are sick to the gills of this ghastly, nasty man, who is more concerned with how to seize power than with what to do once he gets hold of it.\\nWatch it. You can’t miss it. Tell everyone you know that they have to see it too.\\nAnd this is the story behind the story. The Broadcasting Authority first agreed that Pullicino Orlando could represent the Nationalist Party media. Then the Labour delegation arrived: Alfred Sant, his sidekick Jason Micallef, playing Robin to Sant’s Batman, a few other nasty little men, and that horrible photographer who harassed me at the university. Bossily, and with all the hideous arrogance we know from long years of experience with Labour, they demanded a meeting with the BA chairman in the privacy of his office. When journalists tried to follow with their cameras, they were prevented from doing so. Somebody must have filmed the event using a mobile phone or something similar, because NET showed footage of lots of backs and bottoms ascending the stairs and Jason Micallef, still concerned with his appearance even in the tussle, making a fuss.\\nThe Labour delegation returned from that meeting with the BA executives, who announced that they had reneged on their commitment to allow Pullicino Orlando to participate in the press conference. My moles tell me that Alfred Sant made it clear to the BA bosses that he had ‘important ammunition’ to fire at Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, and he wouldn’t feel comfortable firing it at him while he was sitting right there in front of him. And so the Broadcasting Authority accommodated Sant and kicked Pullicino Orlando out.\\nThis is the same Broadcasting Authority that fined Peppi Azzopardi for telling an opinion pollster on camera that he doesn’t agree with Labour’s ‘repeater class’ proposal. Because he is a TVM show-host, the BA takes exception to his voicing of political opinions.\\nJeffrey tells Sant where to put his ammunition\\nBy that time, Pullicino Orlando was already safely installed in his seat in the press benches. Alfred Sant stalks in, shakes Anna Bonanno’s hand, turns round and goes rigid. He points at Pullicino Orlando like an SS doctor selecting a patient for his next genetic experiment in the lab and says: ‘What’s he doing here?’\\nAnd then the showdown begins. Except that it’s a one-sided showdown – Pullicino Orlando challenging Sant to have the guts to look him in the eye and say what he said at the mass meeting, telling him ‘Shame on you! What will become of Malta if you become prime minister? If you are capable of destroying people when you are leader of the Opposition, how much more will you then abuse the more powerful position of prime minister?’\\nSant didn’t look him in the eye once. Instead, he backed off, further and further, and at one point literally turned and ran away into a separate section of the television studio, so that he was filmed standing, ridiculously, under the promotional backdrop for a distributor of cooking implements and other household goods. Meanwhile, the fat photographer who thought it was such a scoop to harass ‘the son of Daphne’, as they call him, giggled like somebody with an IQ of 12. Next to him, Jason ‘Robin’ Micallef stood, giving us his best smile, still concerned primarily with how he looked on camera. And Sant? He was still cowering beneath the Crosscraft backdrop, looking like he was about to start demonstrating the use of a Kenwood mixer.\\nHe had the classic body language of somebody being hunted and on the defensive: arms folded, nervously licking his lips, swallowing conspicuously. And not once did he attempt to engage with Pullicino Orlando in any way. Not once – even though they are both MPs in the same parliament, and as such are obliged to engage with each other and accord each other a modicum of respect, at least in public. If Pullicino Orlando asks Sant a question in parliament, then Sant has to answer, but parliament has been dissolved.\\nSant calls the police\\nWhen he did this, Pullicino Orlando stood up, waved his press card about, and said: ‘That’s it – do your utmost to carry on shackling the free press. Isn’t that what you’re so good at doing? Go ahead – call the police to throw me out! Why don’t you ask them to beat me up as well – like they beat up me and my friends in days you remember well?’ Sant brought out his sheets of notes and pretended to read them, while his fat photographer continued to giggle.\\nThe days when violence and corruption were OK with Sant\\nPullicino Orlando’s words brought back a poignant, but terrible, memory. In the summer of 1986, when Alfred Sant was president of the Labour Party and still married to my husband’s cousin Mary (her mother’s surname is Caruana Galizia), I learned first-hand what ‘zero tolerance to corruption and violence’ truly mean to Sant. I also learned, in a way that shocked me to the core, how the former wife who still follows him around like a loyal dog – even though he left her 23 years ago and never respected her – will excuse anything in the name of the man she adores.\\nMy mother-in-law (her aunt) was at a protest meeting of housewives, in Valletta. They were protesting because we had been left for months on end without water, in the heat of summer. I had a newborn baby and was forced to carry him around to friends to bathe him, and to cross the road to pull buckets of water from the sea to wash the floors and flush the lavatories. I wasn’t at that protest. I was at home, nursing my baby who had diarrhoea thanks to the lack of clean fresh water in our home. Thugs and police attacked those middle-aged, defenceless women. My husband heard the commotion from his office nearby, rushed out and tried to pull his mother from of the melee. The police set on him, beating him to a pulp, while his mother screamed and cried hysterically.\\nHe had to be hauled to a clinic and then brought home, his face a bloody mess. His spectacles had been smashed; his silver cigarette lighter, a memento of his father, had been stolen; his arm was in a sling. He couldn’t move properly. We received a visit from Mrs Sant, who burst into tears when she saw the state of him, and then said: ‘If the police come round to your house to arrest him tonight, ring me at once and I’ll tell Alfred to do something about it.’\\nI was speechless. When I closed the door behind her, I turned to my husband and asked him: ‘Did she really say that?’ In those days, when Labour sent the police to beat you up, they later sent more police to arrest you for the crime of being beaten. We spent the night frozen in fear, waiting for the knock on the door that never came.\\nAlfred Sant knows all about this and the countless other cases of horrible violence in which the Labour government was implicated. He was president of the party, but he said nothing and did nothing. And now I have to watch him on television, posturing about his zero tolerance for corruption. Oh, I didn’t remember: that’s all water under the bridge to him, and he has no regrets.\\nAs he keeps repeating in this campaign: those who tolerate corruption are complicit in that corruption. Zero tolerance for corruption? What I have is zero tolerance for his utter hypocrisy.\\nJust as he doesn’t have the spine to confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando with his ‘ammunition’, so he doesn’t have the spine to confront me. I had a grandstand view of his involvement in the Labour Party in its dirtiest, darkest and most disgusting days, and unlike those voters he tries to convince with his ‘cool’ modernity, I remember everything.\\nI’m watching you, Alfred. And I’ll keep watching you until you leave the Labour Party and leave Malta in peace. It may be water under the bridge for you, but it’s not water under the bridge for the rest of us.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThey told the press that journalists who are electoral candidates are not allowed into their press conferences, because it’s not fair to give them that added exposure.\\nIt looks like they haven’t been watching their own debates, which means that they don’t recognise candidates. Sitting in the back row of the press benches while Pullicino Orlando was challenging Sant, I could clearly see John Spiteri Gingell, the shaggy-haired candidate for Azzjoni Nazzjonali.\\nTwo weights and two measures – neither Chicken Run Sant nor the Broadcasting Authority chairman objected to that one.\\nChicken Run Sant gets Super One to PR his mess\\nThe television is on in the background and Veronique Dalli, wearing spectacles to make herself look more serious and credible, is trying her best to limit her boss’s damage. I wouldn’t do that kind of job for someone who pays me the normal daily rate for working overtime while trying to plaster over his cracks.\\nHighly edited versions are being shown of Chicken Run Sant running rather than facing his interlocutor. Dalli is wrapping her lips around the words ‘provokazzjoni isterika mid-dentist Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando’. Now she’s saying that her boss stayed ‘cool and relaxed’ even in the face of Pullicino Orlando’s verbal tanks and machine-guns.\\nSuper One edited out the bit where Sant calls for the police and Pullicino Orlando tells him, ‘That’s right. Call the police to beat me up, like they beat me up when I was 16’.\\nWig glued on tight\\nIt didn’t help that just an hour earlier, Super One was showing a re-run of Sant’s speech at the St Andrew’s Parade Ground yesterday. His wig was firmly glued to his head in the wind, while the front parts stood up and blew around like a parakeet’s tuft. It wasn’t very impressive. Within two seconds my mother and three sisters were jamming the phone lines, all of us comparing notes. That’s the way it is with women. We’re very interested in hair-styles.\\nPaired with the demagoguery, arm gestures and deliberate intonation that are modelled on film footage of Adolf Hitler, it made me wish that I too, like the Lion of Change, had a santa tal-Madonna fil-but to give me hope that good can win over amorality. You never know. Sometimes it does.\\nMassing for war\\nI didn’t go to the mass meeting yesterday. I stayed at home working, and then watched both mass meetings on television. Lawrence Gonzi had clearly been worn down by Sant’s relentless bitching and mudslinging, and sounded flat, exhausted, tense and a little bit worried. The crowd seemed to have picked up the mood. Sant’s a great one for spoiling the fun. He puts me in mind of one of those negative beings in a Disney cartoon film, the sort that comes looming up to turn the sky dark, so that all the birds stop singing, the flowers wilt, and the hero and heroine are struck down by fear. The spirit of the Dingli Street mass meeting, when Gonzi was on top form, was gone.\\nThere wasn’t much joy on Super One, either. The mad, brooding sense of vindictiveness that reigns over these parades was there again. It emanates from the stage, where a series of foul-tempered speakers with grim faces harangue the crowd and work them up into battle mode. Looking at that red crowd, with its flags on poles, I wondered briefly what it reminded me of. Then I got it: one of those epic historical films where the baron masses his rag-tag army and addresses it from the castle ramparts. The sensation was heightened by all those horns and pennants.\\nHad Sant urged his army to surge through Sliema at that point, raping and pillaging, they might have just done so. That’s the way he hypes them up – filling them with fear, anxiety, worry that somebody might be taking something that’s rightfully theirs, always reminding them that they’re disgruntled, and of course, never forgetting to give that good old inferiority complex another twirl on the gramophone. And let’s not forget the rage he incites against The Others (‘they’ve got what’s rightfully yours, and they’ve taken it by using corruption, like worms in cheese’). You won’t get a single positive word out of a speaker at a Labour mass meeting. It’s negativity all the way.\\nJo Said wants a bodyguard\\nLast week Jo Said, the man who has been pursuing Nationalist MPs and kissing up to Sant, and who called the photographers in when he joined Alternattiva, wrote to the Police Commissioner asking for protection. He said that he has to pay for private security personnel because he is afraid of Winston Zahra Senior.\\nSaid copied his letter to the media, which is how I got to see it. Ah, but here’s the thing: he didn’t just stick to the Maltese media. He also sent it to CNN, Sky News and the BBC – and to the European Ombudsman. I can just imagine that email arriving in the CNN newsroom. ‘Get Christiane Amanpour now! There’s trouble in Malta.’\\nThat evening I ran into Winston Zahra Snr at a party on board the HMS Illustrious. Unlike the Labour Party, I have no policy on warships, and all the nice girls love a sailor. (The HMS Illustrious was twinned that night with the Three Cities, a great honour, but Labour Mayor Boxall shunned the ceremony in line with his party’s policy on bad manners.) Zahra had already heard about Said’s letter to the Police Commissioner, because his son had told him about it.\\n‘‘So what did you do to him, then?’ I asked. Apparently, they ran into each other at Heathrow while waiting for a flight to Malta, and Said began bleating on about government corruption, as he and his new playmate Alfred Sant are wont to do. Zahra tried to change the subject: ‘I told him, let’s talk about football, but he wouldn’t let it go.’\\nSo Zahra moved off. Said followed him, still banging on about corruption. Zahra said, ‘Look, I don’t want to have this conversation’, and moved even further away. Said yelled out, ‘You paid a bribe to get permission to build your hotel at Golden Sands!’ Zahra lunged at Said in a rage, grabbed him by the shirt-collar and rammed him against the wall. Then he called for airport security to say that he was being harassed by a strange man. Said scuttled off, got on the plane to Malta, and wrote to the Commissioner of Police, thinking that his story would make the top slot on BBC News.\\nAnd now here’s Jo Said again\\nDid you see him lurking around in the background when Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando tried to confront Alfred Sant at his press conference outside the MEPA office gates? He tries to play the part of Banquo’s ghost, turning up at the feast like a guilty conscience. At least he’s got the hairstyle right.\\nToday I was sent another of his ‘press releases’, which is doing the rounds. It goes through his trials and tribulations in great and tedious detail, and describes the prime minister as ‘the worst deceitful PM I ever knew in my life’. Funny how all these MLPAD people have forgotten the grave excesses of Mintoff and Karmenu.\\nIn this press release, Said says: ‘I also lodged a report against this Politburo style of governance to the European Union Ombudsman at his Brussels sub-office at the Euro-parliament. I copied Sky News and BBC News with my emails and I wish to have this shown to the public to expose the local regime’s deviousness and extreme way in dealing with dissenters. The local media refuses to publish my happenings (except for the Opposition party’s papers). My reason for going out in public is borne from my pain to see our beloved islands of Malta and Gozo being taken over by the corrupt, by the sects and by the cowboy-clan so shamefully let loose in a population that cannot control them – not even the police – for fear of reprisals. This is happening in what we call a democratic country, under a conservative government and to boot, a member of the EU…..I pray that this ailing society finds the way how to U-turn from this mess. I pray that it plucks up courage to speak out. I yearn for the days when the Maltese children are not brought up in this devious, back-stabbing, corrupt and valueless way of life any more. It is not the fault of the citizens, far from it. It is the fascist regime that is silently and subliminally imposing this mentality on them.’\\nFascist regime – hmmmmm. You can tell that Jo Said has just linked up with AD. Those are phrases its people like to use about the democratically-elected government: fascist regime, one-party dictatorship, single-party rule. And reading through that, I can only wonder where Said, who is many years older than I am, was in the 1980s, when this country had been brought to its knees by corruption and violence. He’s obviously forgotten, otherwise he wouldn’t have spent the last few weeks sucking up to Sant, who was president of the Labour Party in those dark days, telling him how corrupt this government is. Sant doesn’t need any lessons on corruption. He saw quite a lot of it then. And he kept his mouth shut.\\nYou know what? I think Jo Said needs to take up golf.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nI’ve just finished watching BondiPlus. It turns out that just before Labour made such a great fuss about the Safi supermarket permit resignations at the MEPA (the project is one of Charles Polidano’s), Labour’s Lion of Change was seen eating lunch with Ic-Caqnu himself – his guest at the Le Meridien in St Julian’s. I wonder what he chose off the menu – half an ox, probably.\\nYou can’t do anything on this island, can you?\\nAnd so the lovely Rachel Attard found out and confronted the unlovely Alfred Sant under one of his many tents. Sant answered her with the question we have all come to expect from him now, ‘Ghaliex le?’ I’ll put the rest of his reply in English, to save my having to translate for our international viewers: ‘If they were eating together, I hope it was a nice meal in an informal context. Can’t one person eat with another?’\\nApparently not, because when Sant’s stork-like sidekick Charlon Gouder found a years-old photograph of Jesmond Mugliett having dinner with the architect Robert Sant – who is now working on the infamous bridge – he stalked the prime minister with it in his hands for days. You have to hand it to Charlon: he’s a single-issue man. His obsessions verge on perversion.\\nSo let’s see now – why would the Lion of Change have been lunching a deux with Charles Polidano, one of the barons that Labour dislikes so much, saying that he gets whatever he wants from this government? Perhaps the Lion of Change was dispatched to secure a donation for his party’s coffers. We know that Labour are such bad financial managers that they’re always broke. They pay their people peanuts, and when I won a libel suit against them, and they had to pay me around Lm600 (Joseph Muscat was required to pay another Lm600), my lawyer ended up having to place a warrant of seizure on all their bank accounts – and still we just couldn’t find that Lm600. I had to call Jason Micallef and threaten to send in the bailiffs for Alfred Sant’s desk and computer and finally I got a cheque in the mail.\\nThat’s Labour for you. Then they want to tell this government how to make the economy grow by 4% (when it’s growing by 4% already – oh sorry, that was a misprint; we meant 6%).\\nWatch your tongue, Gunther Verheugen\\nGunther Verheugen put in an appearance in the 2003 general election, reminding us that what the Nationalist Party says about Europe isn’t spin but fact. It seems that the people of Malta won’t believe their own prime minister and must have outside confirmation. Needs must when the devil drives.\\nNow here’s Verheugen again, interviewed via satellite link for BondiPlus, telling us that what Sant says he’s going to do isn’t ‘legally possible’, and even if he were to attempt the impossible and try, he’s going to have to knock on 26 prime ministerial doors and make his case to each and every one of them. That’s something that has never happened before, Verheugen said.\\nSant wasn’t on the show to say that he’d bite off his long tongue, like he did last time, but his old friend Evarist Bartolo was, as slimy, snake-like and underhand as ever. And what is this problem that Labour people have with heckling the prime ministers they don’t agree with? My abiding memory of the 2003 general election is of Sant heckling Fenech Adami in that washerwoman’s voice he uses when he’s cross, even as the credits rolled in the last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign.\\nNow here was Evarist Bartolo, talking over the prime minister and interrupting him, not letting him say that the reason Malta is in the Eurozone in the first place is because Sant is wrong about Malta being in a financial mess. You can’t be in a financial mess when you enter the Eurozone. It’s not allowed. If Gonzi were of the washerwoman frame of mind, like Bartolo is despite pretending to be an intellectual like Sant, he might have said: ‘The Labour Party would know all about finances that are in a mess, wouldn’t it?’ But he’s not that kind of man, and that’s why people prefer him to The Other One.\\nGonzi coins a slogan for Labour\\n‘Aghzel Labour ghax ihammeg’ – a sort of reverse washing-powder, perhaps. Throw a dash of Labour in your washing-machine and your laundry comes out dirty and stinking.\\nI have a theory about Sant and the EU\\nHe keeps repeating that the referendum result counted for nothing in his book, that he has no regrets about his stance on EU membership, and that the only verdict he rates is the verdict in a general election.\\nNow he lists the various fights he intends to pick with the European Union. He also has one of those dreadfully incapacitating mindsets that allows for no revision of a fixed view. People miss this fact because on other matters, Sant chops and changes as he goes along, all in the interests of opportunism. But those are minor issues as far as he’s concerned. On his major, life-defining issue of EU membership for Malta, he hasn’t changed his tune for 40 years, and he isn’t going to.\\nSo, taking all these factors and clues into consideration, this is what he’s revving up to do. First he makes it plain that he’s still Eurosceptic and that he plans to ‘renegotiate’ with Europe. That way, we are forewarned of his intentions, and if we elect him prime minister, he will consider himself as having a mandate to press forward with his Eurosceptic approach and his attempts at renegotiation.\\nWhen his renegotiation attempts fail at the first hurdle, he’ll begin trying to pull us away from, and ultimately out of, the European Union. Because he doesn’t believe in referendums, but only in general elections, he won’t even ask us for our opinion. We can march and mass and protest in streets and squares as we did in the 1980s, and he’ll just ignore us and tell us that the result of a general election is what counts, and we voted for him to renegotiate with Europe.\\nGonzi keeps asking why there is nothing in Labour’s electoral programme about what they plan to do with the €855 million in funds that will come in from the EU. Well, that’s the reason why. Sant’s plan is to have nothing whatsoever to do with the EU, still less with its funds. It’s dirty money to him. Show him a bunch of euros, and he recoils. I haven’t heard him say the word ‘euro’ once in this entire campaign.\\nIf he has his way, there’ll be no funds to bother about because there’ll be no EU membership to bother about either.\\nHe still hasn’t forgiven us for voting Yes in that referendum. He really can’t stand us for doing it. He despises all those of us who are pro-European, and that’s another reason he despises university students – because they booed him for trying to keep them out of the EU. That’s why he’s turning this general election into a No vote for Europe and hoping that we’re fool enough not to notice.\\nEvarist the democrat\\nEvarist Bartolo said on BondiPlus that we shouldn’t be afraid Labour will take us out of Europe. With that expression of outraged honour that he likes to wear – when he’s not wearing the one that says ‘I’m an intellectual and you’re not’ – he turned to the prime minister and said: ‘At our party’s general conference in 2001, we decided that if people vote for EU membership in the 2003 general election, we will respect their decision.’\\nAr’hemm hej. Allahares le, as my grandmother would say. How did they structure the question for that vote, I wonder: will we or won’t we respect the people’s verdict in the 2003 general election? Then they vote to respect the people’s decision and applaud themselves for being democratic. What are these people, and which part of what deeply secluded jungle did they come from?\\nYou will notice that Bartolo made no mention of the referendum that lay up ahead when he and his party folk took that landmark vote for democracy at the 2001 general conference. The Iva/Le campaign was already up and running, but they were pretending that no referendum was going to happen. We forget just how bad Sant really is: while Malta was gearing up for a referendum vote, he was gearing up to pretend that it never happened (except for that brief moment when partnership won and he was drunk on a lorry with his tie askew, wondering what fate now held in store for him).\\nVAT on school ties and 5% off an atlas\\nI want to rush at the television screen and give that Evarist Bartolo a good shake when I hear him speaking about things that he can’t possibly believe in. The man wasn’t born without a brain, and he knows how to maximise his advantages. For example, he fought against EU membership in the trenches at his friend Sant’s side, but I knew he couldn’t possibly dislike the idea. Then, when his super-intelligent high-achieving daughter (a really smart girl) won a place at Cambridge, he was able to take advantage of EU membership and the fact that he doesn’t have to pay the crippling fees that apply to non-EU citizens.\\nYou have to hand it to Labour. They really know how to work the very system they pretended to fight against to keep the irascible Sant happy. Some of the party’s keenest front-line anti-EU fighters were the first to stick their noses into the European Commission trough.\\nSo why did I want to give Bartolo a good shake this time? It was when I heard him defend Sant’s nutty proposal about what he claims is VAT on education. Not only is there no VAT on education, but education itself is completely free for those who need it like that, paid for mainly out of other people’s taxes. How do you slap VAT on something for which you pay nothing?\\nThe Labour Party thinks very little of its supporters if it thinks they’ll swallow this. But apparently, some of them do. I watched Claudette Baldacchino interviewing them at a mass meeting the other week and they were all saying how good this measure will be because VAT on education is almost forcing them to go out and beg on the streets.\\nLou Bondi pointed out to Bartolo that the Labour Party defines ‘VAT on education’ as VAT on school ties, atlases, schoolbooks (the VAT on any sort of book is a measly 5%), computers, software, desks, stationery, pens, satchels, shoes, uniforms – with children, the list is endless. As Bondi remarked, what’s to stop parents buying assorted desks and pieces of furniture or computers for themselves, and then claiming them as educational items under Labour’s whacky policy?\\nBartolo wasn’t amused. He put on his expression of outraged honour again. How dare Bondi criticise Sant’s policy? ‘You’d better be careful,’ he warned him in that Labour voice, ‘or we’ll know for sure that what people say about you is true.’\\n‘What do people say about me that’s true?’ Bondi asked. And Bartolo replied, ‘They call your show GonziPlus.’ Oooooooh – harsh one, Ev. You really have to hand it to these Labour big cheeses: the ability to crack a good joke is not their strong point.\\nFor those of you who are curious about this Amazing Plan for VAT Off Education, this is how it works. Bartolo explained it. They’ll get into government and then they’ll see. Just like with the surcharge. And just like when they removed VAT and found themselves reinventing the tax wheel.\\nThey do have a vague outline, though: parents will collect all the receipts for every single pen, pencil, school tie, atlas and blank CD they buy. Then every couple of months they’ll send these mountains of receipts off to a special VAT-Off-Education Department, where a thousand little elves will be employed to sort through the thumbed and well-worn detritus and check each little stub carefully for cheating. Then they’ll them up, work out the VAT element in each total, check the parents’ details, and work out a VAT refund to be allocated along with the children’s allowance.\\nPractical, isn’t it? Just like all Labour’s stupid gimmicks, it doesn’t make sense (why are we not surprised, when the person who comes up with them doesn’t make any sense either?). Wouldn’t it be cheaper and cost far less in man-hours to just slap on a straightforward increase in the children’s allowance cheque?\\nAh, but no – that doesn’t have the right ring of a gimmick about it. VAT-Off-Education (when education is free) sounds a whole lot better than Vote for Us and Get Another €100 of children’s allowance every year. Telenovela Sant is at it again.\\nLabour strikes oil\\nI’m still waiting for the moment in this election campaign when Labour United produces a giant geological map and tells us that its secret oil-rigs have struck liquid gold.\\nUnder yet another tent, this time in Senglea, Sant gave us his word that he will strike oil when elected prime minister (‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’).\\nHe most certainly is hoping he will, because it’s the only chance he’s got of solving the problem he’s landed his party with before they’ve even got into government. Lino Spiteri must be wiping the sweat off his brow with relief that none of this is ever going to be his responsibility.\\nYou see, Sant is still sticking to his guns about halving the electricity surcharge for families (the European Commission won’t let him halve it for businesses, as that counts as state aid), even as the price of oil hit €103 a barrel in the last couple of days. When he first made his reckless commitment, oil cost €89 a barrel. In the mere course of this electoral campaign, the cost to the taxpayer of Sant’s opportunistic electioneering promise has soared by millions of euros.\\nWhere’s he going to get that money? Don’t look around the room, because there’s nobody else there but you.\\nBeing positive hurts them in the guts\\nThe prime minister and Evarist Bartolo were asked to give just one final sentence each to wrap up that edition of BondiPlus. Well, what do you know? Bartolo stuck to the grand old Labour tradition of manipulating negative sentiments. ‘If you have always voted PN and are fed up of this government, come to us. Vote Labour,’ he said.\\nClassy act, our Ev – he would use his last TVM comment before the general election to address the disgruntled Nationalist vote, instead of filling us with hope and inspiration at the wonders of a new Labour government.\\nCome over to the Dark Side. Darth Vader is waiting for you.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIf the Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando case was really that scandalous, then how come AD didn’t know anything about it? Carmel Cacopardo must have fallen asleep on the night-watch. Too bad Jo Said didn’t jump out at him from a bush to yell ‘Corruption!’ in his ear.\\nNow here comes Harry Vassallo, to join forces with his sole remaining potential coalition partner, Alfred Sant. Vassallo called this ‘the obscene Mistra case’. Go back to sleep, Vassallo – or to borrow a choice phrase from my youngest son, just eff off until you get your priorities right.\\nThis campaign has been littered with Labour’s hideous obscenities, and finally Vassallo wakes up from the land of nod and calls something obscene – only it’s not the way that Sant behaved in this case and others. Oh, no – it’s the way a third party put in an application for development on Pullicino Orlando’s land.\\nVassallo should have a little consultation with Cacopardo, a man who seriously needs to have his eyebrows trimmed because they’re taking over the whole show. Tenants apply to the MEPA for permission to develop their landlord’s property all the time. They are supposed to inform the landlord and seek his permission, but they don’t and the MEPA never checks. I live in a green area, all of it agricultural land which is owned by the Joint Office (church-government), and you can bet that when any one of the tenant-farmers wants to build a room for his tools or a rubble wall, dig a reservoir or an artesian well, or put down a cement road for his truck, it’s not the Joint Office that puts in the application. The Joint Office probably doesn’t even know what’s going on.\\nAnd this throws up some very interesting scenarios. Let’s say that when Alfred Sant is prime minister, somebody who pays rent to the Joint Office for a stretch of land decides to apply to the MEPA for permission to build an open-air nightclub or even a pizza parlour. The Joint Office is not informed. What are we expected to do, then – stand outside the Archbishop’s Curia and the Auberge de Castille to shout ‘korruzjoni’? Maybe Harry Vassallo will come out of the woodwork to call Archbishop Cremona and Prime Minister Sant ‘obscene’.\\nAD the watchdog\\nI can’t believe that the AD people are still at it, ranting on about coalitions until the 11th hour. Claire Bonello has colonised the Internet forums to tell people that a seat in a coalition government for AD is crucial because that way, AD can be the people’s watchdog.\\nWhat? The people’s watchdog when the people didn’t vote for AD? How presumptuous and self-important these people are. They don’t even begin to realise how arrogant they sound: 3000 people vote them in to parliament and suddenly they’re the nation’s watchdog. I don’t see Rita Law saying she’s the national watchdog just because she has more votes than AD.\\nBonello didn’t have a ready reply when somebody asked her, ‘In that case, if AD is going to watch the government, who is going to watch AD?’ Because all of its people are as pure as the driven snow, AD has the divine right to govern unchecked.\\nWell, I have news for you. Nobody’s perfect.\\nHarry the rent-law campaigner is a protected tenant\\nOn The Times Internet forum, I have been challenging AD for days to come forward with their much-trumpeted honesty and declare that none of its leading protagonists is a protected tenant. As soon as I post that kind of comment, AD’s input into the debate goes dead silent.\\nThey know that I know exactly which one of them is a protected tenant, and they also know why I’m asking. And like Alfred Sant, they’re too chicken to say, because it kind of undermines their relentless rent-law campaigning on behalf of landlords, if the news gets out that Saint Harry Vassallo is a protected tenant himself and won’t return the keys.\\nYes, he has offices in Valletta which he never uses because he hasn’t worked as a lawyer for years. The offices belong to somebody else and he pays a peppercorn rent every year. The owners have been asking him for a long time for the return of the keys and what’s rightfully theirs. They have to listen to Harry Vassallo rant on about the unfairness of our rent laws while knowing that he’s exploiting the system to suit himself.\\nWhen Vassallo began his rent law reform campaign, they thought their moment had come. Through their lawyer they asked Vassallo to be a gentleman, stand by what he preaches, and return their property to them. Vassallo’s response was a hysterical outburst in a telephone call to the lawyer, complete with lovely threats.\\nI am familiar with those hysterical outbursts because I have seen a few of them at MEPA public hearings. They’re one of the reasons why I think of Vassallo as a latter-day Savonarola – all that screeching denunciation of others. It’s just too much.\\nSo Harry Vassallo the campaigner for landlords is still a protected tenant. My husband wrote a letter about this to Malta Today, and because Malta Today appears to have become part of the MLPAD coalition, it wasn’t published. Never mind – his wife has a blog that’s had 9,500 hits in just 12 hours (and a newspaper column for good measure), so Harry’s little secret is out.\\nHe’s got a right to be a protected tenant\\nOf course he has. That’s exactly what he’s campaigning against: the fact that the law allows people like him to hang on to other people’s property, even when they’re not using it, while paying peanuts.\\nWhen this subject came up at a social gathering recently, an AD supporter defended him by saying, ‘Don’t blame Harry. Blame the law. As long as the law says he should keep it, then he can. That’s why he’s campaigning to change the law.’ Excuse me, but how does that work, exactly? The law allows Vassallo to keep the property, but it does not oblige him to do so. He is free to hand the keys back to the legal owner of the place, and because this is the main tenet of his rent law reform campaign, he should set an example immediately by doing so.\\nBut he doesn’t, because we’re all human. Savonarola has feet of clay, after all.\\nJason il-pilastru ta’ Sant\\nJason Micallef, armed with his vacuous smile even in the most serious of situations, and wearing the expression that says “Everything that goes in from my left ear comes straight out of my right’, huddles up to Sant rather too cosily. On Super One yesterday afternoon, when they sat behind that silly desk trying to explain to the nation why Sant walked out of the PBS studios to avoid nasty Jeffrey, they were shoved right up together, leaning in to each other with their shoulders touching. What purpose does Micallef serve, exactly – literally that of moral support? Would Sant have slid right under the desk without Micallef propping him up?\\nIf Sant feels the need to have a dog around, now that his poodle has been long gone in Brussels, he should get a real one. I can recommend Staffordshire bull terriers. They hug up against their owners and keep nasty journalists and angry MPs away. Oh, and they have a brain.\\nBatman and Robin visit Kennedy Grove\\nIn the final week of the electoral campaign, Batman and Robin are finding nothing better to do than trail around local beauty spots to tell us how malandati they are. First they went to Buskett. Now they’ve gone to Kennedy Grove.\\nI watched them wandering like a funeral procession around the scene of so many of my childhood picnics. It seemed like a violation. I’ll never be able to remember butterflies again. Now all I can think about when I see the Kennedy Memorial is those grim-faced crows.\\n‘What on earth are they doing trailing around Kennedy Grove in the last few days of the campaign, instead of explaining to us what they plan to do when in government?’ I muttered to myself on the sofa. Somebody overheard me. ‘Maybe they’ve run out of mud and have gone to pick up supplies,’ he said. ‘After 16 years of mudslinging, they must have run out.’\\nSomebody else chimed in – ‘Maybe Jason Micallef has been stealing his boss’s supply of mud to use as a face-pack.’ Well, I don’t know about that. He had very deep black circles round his eyes the last time I looked at him. Someone isn’t sleeping.\\nSant’s whistleblowers\\nAD has another rant to share with the MLP: the need for a Whistleblower Act. Sant has found a convenient excuse as to why he won’t release his remaining bits of ammunition, and it’s not that his machine-gun has malfunctioned.\\nHe can’t release this information, he said at his mass meeting, because the people who passed it on to him have changed their minds and said that they feel their livelihoods might be imperilled. Well, what can I say – at least it’s only their livelihoods and not their lives as it would have been when Sant was president of the MLP. Why do I think that this just sounds like a very convenient excuse?\\nIf Sant’s informants in the Pullicino Orlando case and others like them were really whistleblowers in the true sense of the word, they would not have waited until the 11th hour in an election campaign, when they sense that Sant will be the next prime minister, to blow their pathetic little whistles. All this tells me is that they’re trying to curry favour with the next administration and holding out for promotion and a little bit of favouritism. I give you this information and you give me a leg-up.\\nNo Whistleblower Act should ever be used to protect nasty specimens like this, who are only in it for what they can get out of it, and who are certainly not thinking of what’s right or of the national interest.\\nLabour – a slick and professional outfit\\nYou know how the Nationalist Party raised around €500,000 during a fund-raising marathon on NET TV the Saturday before last? Well, the Labour Party felt it had to go one better, and held a fund-raising marathon on Super One the next day. When I switched on the television to take a look late in the evening, the figure hovered at just over €100,000 and the hosts looked a bit down-in-the-mouth.\\nThey’d realised too late that they had made a serious misprint: holding a fund-raising marathon on television while their entire television audience was standing on the Floriana Granaries shouting and waving MLP flags. God, how I laughed: another misprint from Labour; another computer malfunction.\\nI bet it was Jason Micallef and the Lion of Change who dreamt that one up. I’d like to see them trying to slash the deficit to nothing and keep unemployment down if they can’t even work out something like this: that you don’t put on a television fund-raiser while all your donors are at the biggest mass meeting ever.\\nThen they tried to Tippex over this misprint by saying that the Labour Party is il-partit taz-zghir who can’t afford to give donations (and of course, the nasty government has taken all their money anyway) and not il-partit tal-baruni like Joe Saliba’s gang. Maybe the Nationalist Party just has common sense and strong organisational skills, and they don’t.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLast Wednesday, Anglu Farrugia – former inspector in Lorry Pullicino’s force force and shadow minister for justice – rushed down to Police Headquarters and shot the Labour Party in the foot.\\nYou may have wondered why Super One isn’t saying anything about il-kaz skandaluz ta’ korruzzjoni fahhxija fil-Freeport. Well, it’s because Farrugia isn’t the brightest bulb in Labour’s chandelier – and that’s saying something. He didn’t bother to check out the voting preference of the person in question, having assumed that anybody who has links with the Freeport must vote PN.\\nBut as Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando revealed last Saturday, that’s not the case at all. You can be two of Sant’s shadow ministers and have links to the Freeport. You can rent flats to the Freeport for years in the name of a company, then get your wife to sign the back of the rent-cheques and cash them at the bank instead of putting them through the company account. You can do this even during the 22 months when you are sitting in Sant’s cabinet.\\nBir-rispett kollu…ghaliex le? Then you can quickly make a spontaneous declaration to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, put your affairs in order, and allow Sant to say at a press conference that as far as he’s concerned, you’ve done nothing wrong.\\nWell, he would say that, wouldn’t he? Back in 1992, when he was already leader of the Labour Party, I was working as associate editor at The Malta Independent. A hot story came in: the Labour Party leader was the anonymous Malta correspondent of The Economist Intelligence Unit, and he wasn’t declaring his earnings from that source for income tax. We checked it out, found it was true, and ran the piece with comments from a leading tax consultant. Sant is sympathetic to his shadow ministers and their Freeport flats because he’s been in their position. If he were to chastise them, they would say, ‘You’re a fine one to talk, aren’t you?’\\nBut back to Anglu and the scandal that backfired\\nAnglu Farrugia told the Commissioner of Police that he knows of six people who were asked to pay between €2,700 and €2,400 to get a job at the Freeport. The former police inspector revealed with relish that he even knew the name of the person taking the backhanders: Simon Spiteri.\\nNow this is what I mean when I say that Farrugia isn’t the brightest bulb in the chandelier. Spiteri’s nickname is ‘it-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant’. What does that tell you about him? There, you see – even you could work it out, and I mean his political party of choice, rather than his supposed parentage.\\nSpiteri already has a record with the police on similar charges. A few weeks before Farrugia huffed down to his former place of work to file his report, Michael ‘Opus Dei’ Axiaq of the Nationalist Party had filed a similar report about Spiteri, involving other people whose money he had taken.\\nI don’t wish to repeat that bit about Farrugia’s brightness, but it should have been obvious to him that (1) Spiteri’s nickname says a lot about his voting tendencies and (2) he wasn’t taking the money in return for giving jobs at the Freeport, but taking the money and running. After I sat and mulled over this one a little – how on earth does Farrugia imagine that the Freeport human resources division relies on thugs taking money for its recruitment? –something clicked. Of course Farrugia believes this kind of thing happens, because that’s the way it happened in his day under Labour. He probably thinks that it’s still par for the course.\\nFarrugia wasn’t the only one who thought he had scooped a scandal\\nA few weeks back, Labour MP Karl Chircop and shadow tourism minister Evarist Bartolo spoke about cases they knew of in which people were asked to pay money to get a job at the Freeport. They flung their accusations around – Sant taught them well – but refused to give the Commissioner of Police any further details when he asked to have them. There was an embarrassing scene on television with, if I remember rightly, Karl Chircop, in which the interviewer pressed him to explain why he refused to tell the Commissioner of Police who was taking money from people and telling them he could get them a job at the Freeport.\\nAh, now we know why he wouldn’t tell. Unlike Anglu Farrugia, he knows the significance of the nickname ‘it-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant’. I can’t imagine that a news clip which begins ‘Simon Spiteri, maghruf bhala t-tifel ta’ Lorry Sant, huwa akkuzat li ha flus minghand in-nies….’ would serve any possible electoral purpose for the Labour Party.\\nSome people will believe anything\\nWith the Labour administration of 1971 to 1987, corruption was so rampant that there are still people around who think they can bribe their way to whatever they want or need. But really, how disengaged from reality do you have to be to hand money over to somebody who claims to be a Freeport go-between, and who promises to get you a job in return?\\nI suppose you have to be somebody like Anglu Farrugia. The gist of his police report wasn’t that there was a swindler about, taking money off people by making false promises. No, the gist of his report was that a certain individual was taking money in return for Freeport jobs.\\nSome minister of justice he’ll make.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn a bid at salvaging what’s left of his credibility, Alfred Sant raced down to Police Headquarters accompanied by the glossy Jason, the Lion of Change and Charlie ‘DNA’ Mangion. They all looked whey-faced. Sant looked as though the worms in his cheese had eaten his toast.\\nThey were there to meet the man that Sant so memorably described on television as a paraventu ghall-korruzzjoni. I wonder how that went. Let’s picture the scene. Sant walks in with his delegation of four for moral support – we all know he’s a coward – and the inscrutable police commissioner politely avoids the subject of paraventi. Sant doesn’t bring it up to apologise (he has no regrets). The police commissioner offers them a ‘kafe jew tnejn’ and they get down to business. The Lion of Change brings out his lucky santa tal-Madonna and kisses it. Jason fixes his hair and smiles at the handsome police officer by the door. DNA Mangion does a quick mental reckoning of how much the latest batch of flats will bring in.\\nThe Police Commissioner tries hard not to sneak a look at his watch. Privately he might be thinking that if anyone knows about land deals, it’s DNA Mangion. He says nothing, of course.\\nIs a third-party application for construction on land owned by an MP a police matter? Of course it isn’t. It’s a matter for the MEPA auditor. The police only get involved where there are issues of criminality – fraud, bribery, the exchange of money for favours. The Police Commissioner must be very annoyed to see that the man who described him as a paraventu is the very one who is trying to use him as such. By rushing off to file a report with the police, Sant hopes to give us the impression that there is criminality involved. He knows that some people are gullible, and he knows that the police commissioner would never tell him over the telephone, ‘Look here, sir – there are no criminal aspects to this case. Take it elsewhere.’\\nI don’t like the fact that the prime minister referred the case to the police. He’s a lawyer, so he knows that there’s no criminal case involved. By reporting it to the police after he had already reported it to the MEPA auditor, he was just embroiling himself in Sant’s weasel game.\\nSo the wig met the paraventu and got his photo-op outside Police HQ. I’ve just sat through the painful coverage on One News, which is making much of it so as to drown out the sound of mocking laughter and shouts of ‘U-turn ohra!’ and ‘Mela he’s not a paraventu now?’\\nFrom Police HQ, Sant and the other three legs of this particular table went to stand on the steps of the Auberge de Castille in a dress rehearsal for the Big Day. After all, it’s just a short drive from Floriana and oil is only $103 a barrel. The Super One reporter who accompanied this farcical delegation held a reverential microphone to Sant’s lips (‘tmissnix jekk joghgbok’) and asked him why he had done that morning’s brave deed.\\n‘It’s because we are honest and clean,’ he said, while DNA Mangion cast about frantically in his mind for any more rented flats or similar difficulties. The Lion of Change worried briefly about the fact that he hadn’t raised his hand when the boss asked a coffee-morning crowd amusingly whether any of them had a swimming-pool to take advantage of his halved surcharge. After all, he has a fairly nice one at home in L-Iklin, but he would have felt like a prat as the only one with his hand in the air in front of the TVM, Super One and NET cameras.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nBuy the T-shirt at Labour HQ, Mile End\\nSo guess what Alfred Sant did today. He went on a ‘mini tour tal-korruzzjoni’ with the Three Stooges. I am not joking – that’s what he called it. And no, it wasn’t organised by Norman Hamilton Tours, either.\\nThey were in a bit of a hurry, so they scheduled only five stops: the docks (where a journalist reminded him about what happened the last time he raised the subject), the Regional Road bridge (where another journalist asked him whether the next stop would be Birzebbugia, to talk about DNA Mangion’s Freeport flats), and the Transport Authority’s offices (where a journalist asked him whether they would also be going to the airport to talk about the Labour Party’s business delegation to Dubai).\\nYou’re right. You only counted three stops there, not five. That’s because Sant told his press entourage that there wasn’t enough time to make the other two stops – to the MEPA (what a surprise) and to the Ta’ Qali Crafts Village. There’s corruption at the Ta’ Qali Crafts Village? Apparently not – he was only going to drag the press there to talk about asphalting that had never been done. Now that’s a really serious problem. The government should have put the deficit and the Eurozone on hold, and seen to it first.\\nThere was a similar Corruption Tour in the 1996 electoral campaign, but it was much, much busier. They spoke about bus-ticketing machines and barunijiet, paraventi and hbieb tal-hbieb, piling scandal upon scandal. Sant is probably hoping to repeat that success by using the same strategy. In that campaign, people were so focussed on their desire for Schadenfreude, and so impressed by the modern man in his two-sizes-too-large jacket (or is it just that he has unnaturally short arms?) that they never stopped to ask him what he would do once he got into government.\\nHow was he planning to run the country – by shouting abuse from his office window at the Auberge de Castille? To our great horror, we found out that the answer to this question – the one almost nobody asked – was yes. He carried on behaving in government exactly as he had been behaving in Opposition, shouting about hofor and corruption and scaring the bejeezus out of every investor who had half a thought of coming here to set up shop. And all we got was a hofra that grew by the day and soaring unemployment.\\nBring it on. We’re waiting.\\nChicken Run Sant and his Three Stooges have just two days of campaigning to go. If they don’t use them to tell us what in heaven’s name they plan to do when in government – except wreak chaos, that is – we are never going to find out until it’s too late.\\nThe closer we get to the day, the more ridiculous their stunts and gimmicky campaigning become. And everywhere they go, they look like a funeral procession trailing gloom and doom in their wake. They’re like a bunch of gangster extras from Pulp Fiction – the ones that were left on the shelf just in case the real actors called in sick. Three of them look about as light-hearted as circling vultures, and the other one splits his face into a look-at-me smile every time he sees a camera.\\nChicken Run Sant and his winning team in the winning bus\\nWell I must say, they’re very confident, aren’t they? This week, the kowc tal-bidla has become the kowc tar-rebha. And with all those morose and glowering vultures on board, it isn’t the most inspiring sight.\\nSant is turned on by corruption\\nThe only time we ever see him animated is when he’s talking about corruption. Then he gets really excited. His dead-fish eyes light up. His face comes alive. His body actually moves like that of a normal person, instead of the usual lower half of one arm jerking oddly from the elbow, with the trunk of the body and the shoulders rigid as though held fast in a full-body cast. And please don’t get me started on the hands. Each time he holds up his right hand in that palm-upward, thumb and forefinger gesture, the only thing I can think of is how unusually small and neat it is for a man’s. Girly hands on a man give me the heeby-jeebies.\\nI used to think that Chicken Run Sant had an obsession with corruption. Now I think it’s a fetish. At the merest trigger of a suggestion, he becomes lost in a reverie of kafe jew tnejn, dud fil-gobon, networks tal-hbieb (‘this is the trouble with corruption; they cover up their tracks’). It’s an oft-repeated and well-rehearsed spiel, and it’s now verging on a sick obsession. I can actually see his mind spinning through the plots. It’s the thwarted novelist in him. Chicken Run Sant is out to get Them, but if They confront him, he runs away to the warm safety of Jason and the Super One studio.\\nSant goes back to the studio after first checking the premises for signs of Jeffrey\\nThe sight of Chicken Run Sant being turned on by talk of corruption was the (poor) highlight of his Broadcasting Authority ‘press conference’ (for it is anything but) which was televised earlier tonight. This was the one that had to be rescheduled after he fled in his getaway Mazda at the sight of Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando in the recording studio.\\nThe only time we saw him come alive in that dead show was when he found an opening to start banging on about corruption and how They cover Their tracks. Who are These people? Well, we don’t know, do we, because Chicken Run Sant isn’t telling. His latest excuse is that he’s waiting for the Whistleblower Act to protect his sources. Why doesn’t he wait until he becomes prime minister and promote them instead? After all, that’s probably what they had in mind when they passed on their hot tips.\\nThat nice, sensible journalist from Il-Gens asked him how long he’d had his ammunition, but Sant wasn’t telling. ‘It doesn’t matter how long I’ve had it,’ he said. Translated, this means he’s had it for a long time, but doesn’t want to say so because he knows it makes him look like an opportunist out to win an election by any means, rather than somebody who genuinely has the national interest at heart.\\nThe nice journalist pressed home his point (nicely): ‘But do you think it’s the right thing to do, making all these accusations in the last week of the campaign, when the people you are targeting don’t have the right opportunity to counter your claims, and when the people who are voting don’t have the time to weigh up the situation properly?’ Chicken Run Sant wouldn’t budge. Instead he took this as the cue for more excited talk about corruption.\\nThat no-nonsense Amanda from the Nationalist Party press pointed out that he hadn’t called a press conference, published a book in the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti or reported the matter to the Paraventu Commissioner (my words, not hers) when he was prime minister and his personal assistant – that man who looks like an unemployed waiter, Joe Borg – was found to have been building a ‘farmhouse’ without a permit in a rural area. Sant performed his party trick and blanked her completely, taking her question as yet another cue to thrill to the excitement of corruption under a Nationalist government.\\nAmanda wasn’t having any of that. She asked him what he planned to do about his shadow minister of finance (and the other one) who had been found not to have declared earnings from flats rented to the Freeport, at a time when both of them were in Sant’s cabinet.\\nSo if Chicken Run Sant becomes prime minister, we’re going to have a minister of justice who was a police inspector in the early 1980s under Lorry Pullicino, and a finance minister who sent his wife to cash his rent-cheques and failed to declare the income. And then Sant has the nerve to scream and shout about the failings of others.\\nThe spiel about the reception class changes yet again\\nFirst they said it would mean an extra year in school, and all the kids would leave at 17. Then they said it would apply to all schools – state, church, and independent – because of the national curriculum. Then they justified it by saying it was based on the British system. Then when it was pointed out to them that our system is already the British system because it was set up by the British, and that British children leave compulsory schooling at 16, they changed the story again. Compulsory schooling wouldn’t end at 17, but at 16. But it does so already, we said, and scratched our heads.\\nSo where was that extra year going to be squashed in, then? Perhaps they’ve teamed up with Paul Vincenti and Gift of Life to teach three terms in the womb – nine months is just perfect.\\nIn his BA press conference tonight, Sant tried to clear up the mystery by adding to it. He actually answered one question, and it was about this. A year is not necessarily a year, he said. It could be three months. Or it could be a year. And it could be after kindergarten, or before primary, and you know how some children are born in January and others are born in September (yes, Alfred, we did know that), well that’s what he means and that explains it then.\\nThe nice journalist from Il-Gens, who asked the question, looked as though he had been pinned to the wall by a Scientologist intent on explaining to him how alien beings can spy on his thoughts if he doesn’t wear a tin-foil hat.\\nAnd none of us are any the wiser. It looks like this repeater class is going to be a rerun of the tax nightmare of ’96.\\nA comment posted on this blog, which deserves further attention\\n“I notice that many people believe that Alfred Sant’s behaviour at the BA press conference was acceptable. Maybe that is why he believes he can behave in such a manner with impunity.\\nPeople who think Sant’s behaviour is acceptable are not familiar with the internationally accepted protocols of press conferences. I have attended several and have never seen a situation where any prospective speaker asked for the removal of a member of the audience and called for the police to ensure that it happens, much less a speaker who is a would-be and has-been prime minister.\\nThere have been many occasions when speakers at press conferences faced a challenging audience, knowing their every move and word would be broadcast around the world. That is exactly what they did. They faced their audience and they took their questions. They didn’t split hairs over whether those questioners had a right to be in the room; they didn’t call for the police to remove the people they didn’t like, and they didn’t evoke the letter of the law to back up their presumption that they do not need to respond to questioners they don’t like.\\nIt matters little who mentioned the police first in this row. What matters is that would-be Prime Minister Sant expects the police to help him silence an opponent.\\nIt is sinister that institutions set up to ensure free and fair information fail in their mission because of pressure from a would-be prime minister.” – Corinne Vella\\n  \\n\\n  \\nLet us all pause for a while and remember the historic day in 1996 when Alfred Sant took a break between corruption tours and mud-slinging and went to a supermarket before the election. He made his xirja, came back, and told us in a shocked press conference how much it cost. I watched him on television unpacking his qoffa and discussing the prices of items, and all I could think of was Gloria Mizzi on TVM in my childhood, doing pretty much the same thing but so much more attractively.\\nAnd of course, he drove to the supermarket in his getaway Mazda, paid for by the tax-payer as is the Leader of the Opposition’s privilege.\\nThat xirja stunt helped him become prime minister. And when he became prime minister, the cost of his xirja rocketed within just a few months – thanks to his introduction of 33 new taxes, water and electricity bills that were higher than they are now, surcharge and all, at a time when oil cost just $12 a barrel (it now costs $103) and his punitive and tortuous replacement of VAT with CET.\\nWatch this clip for some amusing memories of Sant and his qoffa. Remember, this was the man who captured the imagination of enough people to make him prime minister then. There’s really no accounting for taste. It’s hard to believe that he’s still around, and still trying to pull the same kind of stunts.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nWe have our first libel suit, and what a surprise – it’s from Michael Falzon, the studious kid who was never allowed out into the street to play with all the rest of us hamalli children who lived on the block. Michael and his brother Silvio would spend their free time studying hard in the grocer’s shop owned by their rabidly Mintoffjan father, who was determined that his kids would grow up to be better than the tal-pepe kids rolling around like peasants in the gutter and chasing each other with stones. If you want some insight into what makes Michael Falzon so obsessively driven in that ‘I’ve got it in for you all and I’m going to get to the top to get my revenge’ way, I’m the one who has it.\\nMichael would sit there listening to his father praise Dom Mintoff to his tal-pepe clientele when they popped round every afternoon to collect their hobza and ‘ration’. This was in Stella Maris Parish, the most chi-chi part of Sliema – so you can imagine that it didn’t make him the most popular grocer around. And neither did it do anything to help Michael integrate into the street-gangs that were de rigeur and which included all sorts, including a lovely boy called Etienne who suffered from a wasting disease and who let us hitch fast and dangerous rides down the hill on the back of his wheelchair.\\nMy mother would come home and say, ‘Look at Michael and Silvio – they’re always studying and doing their homework, and you’re always fighting in the street or running around somewhere.’ Now I tell her, ‘You were right, ma –had I been a good girl and studied harder, jahasra, I might have ended up deputy leader of the Labour Party.’\\nApparently, Michael Falzon is not bisexual. Well, I don’t think any of us ever had any doubts about that. Bring it on, Michael ta’ Muse – I’m going to love every minute of this one.\\nAnd here’s a link to one of his best performances yet:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kiZ6qKKat4\\nThe Lion of Change has a fertility thermometer\\nMichael Falzon went down to Hal-Qormi yesterday to have another good shout: ‘It-termometru qed jimmarka Lejber!’ If anyone has the clip, please send it to me immediately. I’m sure you’re generous enough to share it with others.\\nMaybe he was seeing the red dot at the end.\\nIt looks like this man’s ambition is to elbow his boss out of the way and become party leader himself. I trust that the alarm-bells are ringing already at the Glass HQ. Falzon, as if you hadn’t noticed already, models himself on Dom Mintoff, with all his vulgarity and crassness and few of the brains.\\nIf Sant loses this election, he’s definitely got to be put out to pasture. And for the sake of us all, the Labour Party has to choose a decent, stable and acceptable leader, preferably somebody with a normal home background, instead of yet another ghazeb or weirdo without a wife in the picture. You may think that this is an unimportant detail, but all you have to do is consider how important a part of Lawrence Gonzi’s arsenal Kate is, and you will see what I mean.\\nLet’s put it this way. If Labour had been sensible enough to pick somebody like George Abela, instead of the current fright-show, we wouldn’t be in this constant state of tension today. Imagine it and sigh with regret: a straight contest between George Abela and Lawrence Gonzi, two men with remarkably similar profiles and images, two sound, solid and regular guys. It would have been bliss compared to this nightmare fight-to-the-death between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nMy sister Corinne Vella (the 42-year-old who Maltastar.com described as a ‘young student’ whom I had brought along to help me rabble-rouse at the university debate) posted this comment further along. It’s addressed to Victor Laiviera, a personal friend of Alfred Sant who has taken it upon himself to defend him all over the Internet. I don’t want you to miss it, so I’m posting it here.\\nCorinne is too self-effacing to spell it out herself, but her perspective on the matter is probably one of the most relevant that anyone living here in Malta can give. For the last few years she has worked in the press centre of every single major World Economic Forum Meeting in various parts of the globe, including the January meeting for world leaders in Davos. The press conferences which she helps organize, and for which she is present, are not the sterile and meaningless ‘press conferences’ organized by the Broadcasting Authority, featuring Alfred Sant and a selection of journalists bearing state-approved cards from the government’s Department of Information, but massive events crowded with the world’s top media – CNN, BBC, The New York Times, the London broadsheets, and hundreds of others – and the person being grilled under the spotlight of several television cameras is a world political or business leader. And because Alfred Sant and his friend Frans Sammut, who wrote a hagiography about him in which photocopies of his Harvard certificates were included as colour plates, value these such things far more than experience and ability, I should point out to them that she also holds a postgraduate degree in communications from the London School of Economics.\\nOn this matter, as on others, her opinion is worth a whole lot more than Victor Laiviera’s, friend of Sant.\\nIn my last two posts I mentioned my experience of attending several international press conferences. I did so because it underpins what I have to say on this matter, not to score points over Victor Laiviera, as he seems to think.\\nI stand by what I said. It is NOT acceptable under any circumstance for a speaker at a press conference to ask for a person to be evicted from the room. The only time this is acceptable is when that person poses a security risk. A threat to life and limb is a security risk. A challenge to accusations of corruption is not. There are no two ways about this. I did not mention this exception earlier as I took it to be self-evident. Given Mr Laiviera’s obstinacy, it appears I was wrong.\\nVictor Laiviera, as others do, keeps arguing about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando when the spotlight is shining the other way. If Alfred Sant gets his way, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando will be out of the political scene and Alfred Sant will be Prime Minister. That is why Sant’s behaviour is the central issue in this dispute. To Sant’s fans, his behaviour is heroic. To others it is sinister. Perhaps even Sant’s fans know this: their only defence of Sant in this matter is to say that his political opponent was in the wrong.\\nIt was Sant’s behaviour, and not Pullicino Orlando’s presence, that disrupted the press conference. Sant the would-be Prime Minister believes it is his prerogative to decide who can say what and when. That is a dangerous belief that Sant’s fans would have us all sanction.\\nIt is, was, and should remain the moderator’s prerogative and responsibility—and not the speaker’s—to manage a press conference. Alfred Sant knows this, which is why he normally moderates his own press conferences, an arrangement that enables him to ignore questioners he does not like.\\nIn the many international press conferences I have attended, there have been several occasions when members of the audience included people who are not journalists.\\nMany times the open hostility between speakers and people in the audience was known and visible beforehand.\\nOn several occasions, speakers faced questions that caused them great discomfort and embarrassment during press conferences that were being broadcast live on global TV networks.\\nThere have been numerous occasions when a journalist’s existence—not mere presence in the press conference room—was considered by a speaker to be a personal affront and abomination.\\nI could extend that list, but that will do for now.\\nNEVER in any of the situations I mention did any speaker refuse to take to the podium unless a member of the audience was first evicted, particularly not under police escort. And if any such request had been made, the press conference host, not just the moderator, would have refused to comply.\\nYou see, when the world’s media are watching, a sensible speaker faces with good grace any challenging question, however hostile, rather than refusing to take any questions at all.\\nAnd here, in tiny Malta, with only the local media watching, would-be and has-been Prime Minister Sant could not face up to a political opponent and so he asked for him to be removed under police escort.\\nEvidently Sant thinks that it is normal and acceptable to silence opponents. Otherwise, camera savvy as he is, he would not have called for the person’s removal under police escort while the local TV cameras filmed his every gesture and word.\\n– Corinne Vella\\nThese are not from my Little Red Book\\nThe penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men – Plato\\nThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing – Edmund Burke\\nIf a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be – Thomas Jefferson\\n  \\n\\n  \\nPretty-boy Jason took to the studio at Super One to announce that those involved in the production of the very interesting Miriam Dalli/Maria Muscat/Charlon Gouder video on YouTube would be made to pay. Even as he spoke, Labour’s lions of change were hunting them down.\\nQuite frankly, I’m sure Michael Falzon would prefer to spend his time munching on half an elephant while letting off fireworks and kissing his lucky santa tal-Madonna, in between bouts of floating about in his surcharged swimming-pool while chatting on the mobajl to Natalie, but never mind. Let him hunt.\\nThe point here, my dear ‘Robin’, is not who produced the video, who uploaded it, or who disseminated it, but whether what’s in it is true. And Jason had nothing to say about that.\\nSo if it’s untrue then it’s libellous and you can do your impossible best to find out who did it and sue. But if it’s true – well, I’m sorry folks, but you’ve just discovered the meaning of the Biblical phrase that he who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind.\\nMiriam Dalli is head of One News, after all – a television show that has nothing to do with news and everything to do with lies, cheating, persecution of the innocent, mud-slinging, hoodwinking the gullible, and a thousand other acts of despicable behaviour. She’s a beautiful woman and she’s fairly smart. In her position, a better person would have taken advantage of those assets and deployed them to great effect in the private sector, not taken God’s gifts and used them to mop the floor of the urinals at a Hells’ Angels meeting, so to speak. Imagine if the individuals involved in these cases had been the head of Net News and a Nationalist Party reporter. Super One would have rammed the subject down our throats over an entire month, but Net hasn’t said a word about this, and that’s the difference between the two political parties.\\nIt’s interesting, though, to see that Labour’s reaction to this taste of their own medicine (except that it’s not really a taste of their own medicine, because we have been given to understand that the facts in the video are correct, while Labour prefers lies), is to hunt down the perpetrator using the giant party machine and exact revenge. Typical Labour – old Labour, new Labour, they’re all the same. Clean out your house. You really need it.\\nStudents boo Sant; Sant sends in his tanks. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando challenges Sant; Sant calls the police. A video goes on YouTube showing the alleged extra-curricular activities of Charlon Gouder, Miriam Dalli and Maria Muscat, and Jason Micallef goes on television to promise revenge on those responsible. Those responsible, Jason? Why don’t you take a look around your own studio?\\n  \\n\\n  \\nChicken Run Sant ran for shelter yesterday evening to a tent in Qormi and stood behind a business-breakfast podium to speak to a crowd of… better not say it.\\nHe was safe and secure in the knowledge that here he was among admiring eyes who think of him as superior, after having seen the 1979 Harvard certificate that his friend Frans Sammut so kindly reproduced in his award-winning best-seller, ‘Alfred Sant: Vizjoni ta’ Bidla’ (Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti).\\nJason and the Lion of Change having already frisked the gentlemen and searched the ladies’ handbags for the presence of a serious security threat called Jeffrey, the Cowardly Custard felt it was safe to proceed. Having fled to the Crosscraft set in the PBS studios when confronted by an angry dentist who is perfectly qualified to carry out the threat (which he didn’t make) ‘naqlaghlek snienek’, he now felt safe to say what was on his mind.\\nAnd this is what he said: he will only confront Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando in court and with his lawyer present. Funny, but I thought that his lawyer was present in the studio that day. I thought his lawyer is always stuck to his right hip. Isn’t Michael Falzon a lawyer? Yes, that’s right – he’s a lawyer who is employed by Bank of Valletta plc. He seems to have saved up quite a lot of vacation leave, or maybe he’s just taking unpaid leave. He would always do the right thing, of course. The deputy leader of the Labour Party would never sink to the level of the disgusting Nationalists and abuse of his position.\\n‘He expected to have an exchange of views with me, imma jien ma nitkellimx ma’ nies bhalu,’ Chicken Run Sant said. I apologise for using the vernacular, but it’s the only thing that seems appropriate here: ar’hemm, hej. Zutt! If they lived 200 years ago, Pullicino Orlando might have challenged Sant to a duel at dawn and our feathered friend would have run clucking away.\\nSo let’s disabuse Big Bird of the notion that he needn’t engage in any exchange with Pullicino Orlando ever again. After this election, they’re both still going to be MPs, whichever side of the house they’re sitting on. In parliament, Sant can’t refuse to answer Pullicino Orlando’s questions. He is obliged to answer them. He forgets that Pullicino Orlando is neither a journalist who can be ignored nor a student who can be harassed.\\n‘Then what did he do? He went on television and cried,’ Henrietta the Hen said in a sarcastic voice. The crowd in his wigwam jeered. Labour – the party of unpleasantness. No wonder they end up with such ghastly leaders.\\nMichael Falzon lets off fireworks\\nBesides hunting in Romania, the Lion of Change (OK, I know it’s the lioness who hunts while the male sleeps, but if I call him a woman he’ll sue me again) has another hobby. ‘I have a licence to let off fireworks,’ he proudly told his interviewer.\\nThe feast of Stella Maris parish in Sliema must be the most low-key festa in the entire Maltese calendar. The sorts of people who live in that neighbourhood are not the kind to follow the vara up the street and get drunk in the local hanut tat-te (there aren’t any).\\nBut Falzon loves it, and he probably keeps it going singlehandedly, even though he now lives, famously, with a swimming-pool in L-Iklin (thank God for his feathered friend’s promise to halve the surcharge – you can really struggle on a BOV salary). I might be wrong, but he’s probably the only one behind that vara in August.\\nAs he explained to his interviewer, he loves brass bands and fireworks. Along with hunting and santi tal-Madonna, these are his hobbies (and writing poy-ims, too).\\nSo then I wondered whether this passion of his has anything to do with the fact that when the kowc tal-bidla – sorry, kowc tar-rebha – arrives in town, the cross vultures on board are greeted with loud, bright suffarelli.\\nIt’s against the law to let them off in public like that, and there are always policemen around – but hell, what’s a little bit of law-breaking when you’re trying to set an example?\\nThe Lion of Change is an intellectual\\nMichael Falzon told a recent interviewer that he writes poetry. You could picture her eyebrows going up, because he said, ‘Yes, really.’\\nThen one of the radio stations (I forget which, but it was probably Super One) broadcast one of his poy-ims. Here it is.\\nMorna fin-nort;\\nMorna fis-sawt.\\nMorna fl-east;\\nMorna fil-west.\\nLejber is de best.\\nSome interesting passages from ‘The Moral Basis of a Backward Society’\\nThe political scientist Edward C. Banfield wrote The Moral Basis of a Backward Society in 1958. He describes the people of a town in southern Italy, with emphasis on their political and social behaviour, showing how they were reluctant to cooperate or to maintain any kind of continuing relationship beyond those of the nuclear family.\\nBanfield argued that the people he studied behaved at all times as if they were following a rule which he called amoral familism, the guiding principle of which was to maximize the material gains and short-run advantage of the nuclear family, assuming always that all others will do the same. Those with no families he described as following a principle called amoral individualism.\\nBecause of its relevance to Malta in 2008, I thought you might be interested in some passages from this study of southern Italy 50 years ago.\\n“The amoral familist who is an office-holder will take bribes when he can get away with it. But whether he takes bribes or not, it will be assumed by the society of amoral familists that he does.”\\n“In a society of amoral familists, the claim of any person or institution to be inspired by zeal for public rather than private advantage will be regarded as fraud.”\\n“The amoral familist will use his ballot to secure the greatest material gain in the short run. Although he may have decided views as to his long-run interest, his class interest, or the public interest, these will not affect his vote if the family’s short-run, material advantage is in any way involved.”\\n“The amoral familist will value gains accruing to the community only insofar as he and his are likely to share them. In fact, he will vote against measures which will help the community without helping him because, even though his position is unchanged in absolute terms, he considers himself worse off if his neighbours’ position changes for the better. Thus it may happen that measures which are of decided general benefit will provoke a protest vote from those who feel that they have not shared in them or have not shared in them sufficiently. In 1954, the Christian Democrat Party showed the voters of Basso that vast sums had been spent on local public works. Nevertheless, the vote went to the Communists. …It seems likely that the very effectiveness of the Christian Democratic propaganda may have helped to cause its defeat. Seeing what vast sums had been expended, the voters asked themselves: Who got it all? Why didn’t they give me my fair share? No amoral familist ever gets what he regards as his fair share.”\\n“In a society of amoral familists, the voter will place little confidence in the promises of the parties. He will be apt to use his ballot to pay for favours already received (assuming, of course, that more are in prospect) rather than for favours which are merely promised….The principle of paying for favours received rather than for ones merely promised gives a great advantage to the party in power, of course. In effect, however, it is often more than offset by another principle, as follows. In a society of amoral familists, it will be assumed that whatever group is in power is self-serving and corrupt. Hardly will an election be over before the voters will conclude that the new officials are enriching themselves at their expense and that they have no intention of keeping the promises they have made. Consequently, the self-serving voter will use his ballot to pay the incumbents not for benefits but for injuries, i.e. he will use it to administer punishment. Even though he has more to gain from this party than from any other, the voter will punish a party if he is confident that it will be elected despite his vote. The ballot being secret, he can indulge his taste for revenge (or justice) without incurring losses.”\\nAmen. It looks like we haven’t travelled very far in the last half a century: using our vote to teach the party in government a lesson but hoping it will be elected all the same, sulking because we haven’t got our fair share (and as Banfield points out, people like this never do get their fair share, no matter how much they get), keeping an eye on what the others are getting so that we can use our vote to break off their connections. Yes, yes, yes – but Banfield was writing about a hick town in southern Italy in 1958 – and here we are, still thinking and behaving the same way.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nYou really have to watch this video. Turn the volume RIGHT up.\\nHarry Vassallo and the prison sentence\\nThere is something not quite right about this story, so I am not going into detail until we do have the details.\\nYet these are my immediate observations. The government had nothing to do with it, because with the separation of powers, the government can’t influence the decisions or workings of the courts. It was not the government that converted the fine to a prison sentence. It was the courts.\\nSo why did the police turn up to arrest him today when the fine was converted to a prison sentence as far back as October? These are precisely the details we need. In my understanding of these situations, when the police turn up to take you to prison, they give you just enough time to pack your bag. They do not allow you to call a press conference, go home to your wife and kids and decide what comes next.\\nWe need a statement from the Commissioner of Police, and we need to see those court papers.\\nIt appears that this process has been on-going for years, and that the case, or so we were told at the press conference, was decided months ago. Why, then, did Harry Vassallo say nothing about it? He should have been the first to let his supporters know, instead of letting them find out in this manner. Instead, he kept it quiet and even more quietly made his plea for a presidential pardon. He did so even as AD and its activists were raising hell about the plea for a presidential pardon put in by a clerk at the Transport Authority, who had taken a bribe.\\nI’m sorry to have to point it out at this delicate juncture, but this is along the same lines as Vassallo campaigning for the rights of landlords versus protected tenants when he is a protected tenant himself and refuses to hand the property back to the owners. When he realised that my husband knew about it, as the lawyer for the landlord, he rang him, shouted insults and threatened him with all manner of verbal abuse not to go public with it. My husband is not the kind of man who likes to go public with things, and it had never occurred to him. But Vassallo, of course, was concerned about me.\\nMy first reaction when I read the story was oh God, oh no, I can’t believe this is happening. His poor wife, I said; his poor kids. I even had lots of sympathy for him. We all make messes in our lives; it’s how we handle them that counts. But then I said, for heaven’s sake – if the shopkeeper down the road were to find himself in the same situation, what would we say about it? We would say that he should have put his affairs in order and not let things reach that messy stage. The VAT department is actually not that draconian. Its aim is to collect revenue, not to put people in prison. It would rather have the money than somebody in jail. People are regularly fined for not filling in VAT returns. They somehow get the money together and pay, or they cope with the consequences as best they can.\\nThe thing about Harry Vassallo is that he thinks of himself as a common man with uncommon advantages. Where it suits him, he is the common man – hanging onto the protected tenancy of a place that lies empty, failing to keep his affairs in order, applying for a presidential pardon. And then where it suits him, he exercises his uncommon advantages – expecting to neither pay a fine nor serve a prison sentence, calling a press conference to protest against something that very many others have endured but blamed only their own muddling inefficiency for.\\nVassallo kept the whole process secret for all these years – it does take years – so then why didn’t he keep this last stage secret too? Why didn’t he go to his extended family for help, pay the fine and move on, perhaps trying to find ways to pay back his dues? Please don’t tell me that his siblings and in-laws would rather see him go to prison than help him pay the fine.\\nHe had another choice: to be open about it from the beginning. But this hybrid decision, first keeping things hushed and then calling in the press to try to stay the course of justice and score some sympathy votes in the process, worries me. What it tells me is that if Harry Vassallo had got the presidential pardon he asked for, none of us would have known about it. The process was kept quiet right up to that stage, and so the presidential pardon would have been kept quiet too.\\nThis doesn’t ring right. Vassallo has made a political career out of criticising similar failings in other politicians, of telling us that he and his people are the only ones who are squeaky clean, of insisting that AD in a coalition government will police the politicians. Ah, I asked at one point: but then who will police AD?\\nHarry Vassallo has been challenging the prime minister for refusing to enter into coalition with him. After this, the prime minister must be thinking that it’s a damned good thing he warded off those particular advances. Imagine if, at this late stage in the electoral game, the PN and AD were fighting the election as coalition partners, and this news broke. Vassallo can play the small martyred victim now, but as the coalition partner of a large party machine, he wouldn’t have been able to do that all. He would have embarrassed the Nationalist Party hugely, and might even have cost them the election.\\nYes, of course I feel for Harry Vassallo in that position – very much, too. But most of all, I feel for the wife and children whom he has dragged into this appalling mess, standing under the television cameras and blaming the government for persecuting him, as though it was the government who was responsible for filling in his VAT returns.\\nHis persecution mania is now wholly out of control. Some weeks ago, he accused Tonio Fenech of using his (Harry’s) son to score a political point, for which Fenech later apologised. Now here Vassallo is, using his young children to gain sympathy votes at a press conference, portraying himself as the victim of King John’s tax collector. If he doesn’t want his children used, then he should start by not using them himself.\\nChildren of that age should be protected at all times from their parents’ problems. No children so young should be made to stand in front of the cameras and made to worry about things they don’t fully understand, like their father going to prison. I think it is despicable to do this to them. When our front door was set on fire by criminals in the middle of the night 13 years ago, my husband and I worked right through to dawn to clear up the mess, so that when the children woke up, they wouldn’t notice that anything had happened. And then, of course, they went to school and some tactless teacher asked the eldest about it, and he said no, everything was normal at home. I can just imagine how worried those kids are. And it’s not the government’s fault, or the fault of any evil oppressors. It’s their own father who is letting them down.\\nThe latest update as I write this is that the police are investigating because there seems to be a discrepancy between what Vassallo said and what in fact happened.\\nBut this still leaves everyone with a problem – because of course, Harry being Harry, he has made his personal problem a national quandary. If Vassallo goes to prison, we will all be very upset. And if he is given special treatment that is not available to anyone else, purely because he is the leader of a political party, then we shall be upset too – not least because he is the leader of a party that campaigns against just such abuse of the system by politicians.\\nThis isn’t China\\nThere’s a lot of confusion about press cards, so I’m going to weigh in with my two cents’ worth. When I first started working, we didn’t need press cards to go to press conferences. We just turned up. That’s the way it should be. In all these years, I have never had a press card – yet I think you will agree that I am somebody who works for a newspaper.\\nThere were a few times when I needed a press card, but that was only for international conferences and similar events held in Malta. The press card served the purpose of a security pass. It wasn’t proof that I worked for a newspaper. It was proof that I had a reason to enter the premises and that I wasn’t about to let loose with a machine-gun.\\nBecause these events were usually organised by or in association with the government, the security/press pass was issued by the government’s Department of Information. Because the media scene in Malta was still highly undeveloped (a few newspapers and state television and radio), Malta was not accustomed to a system of accreditation by the media organisation itself. This is the system used elsewhere: the press card is issued by the journalist’s employer, and serves simply as proof that the person in question represents that media organisation. It is not proof that he is a journalist.\\nIn the free world, press cards are not issued by the state. I am amazed to find myself having to explain why, when the reasons should be obvious. Any organisation that has the power to issue a press card also has the power to refuse to issue it, and the power to withdraw it. No government should have such power over the very individuals who are there to scrutinise it. Hasn’t this occurred to anyone?\\nStrange ideas about journalism\\nI have noticed over the years that there are some very strange ideas about journalism here in Malta. It is assumed by the Labour Party, for example, that I am paid by the Nationalist Party to write my newspaper column – because a newspaper column written as it should be was completely outside the Maltese experience before I started doing it. Yet it was not outside, for example, the British experience and we are not without London newspapers here. So I can only conclude that the people who think like this don’t read anything except the backs of their cigarette packets.\\nWhen it was pointed out to them that writing a newspaper column is an actual real job, there was much fluttering among the pigeons, and the Labour elves came up with an interesting new insult: ‘You are a paid columnist’. One wishes to weep, but enough of that is being done in public, so forbearance is called for.\\nSeveral years ago, Georg Sapiano, who was then working for television and radio, suggested in conversation that he believed journalists should have warrants like the other professions. (I wouldn’t imagine he still holds the same view as this was a long time ago.) A very heated argument ensued. Journalism is not like accountancy, law, architecture or medicine, I told him. It cannot be put into the same bundle. The other professions require state warrants only for the protection of the citizen, to ensure that clients or patients are not cheated or hurt by a false or fraudulent practitioner.\\nThe role of a journalist is completely different, and a journalist should never be put in a situation where he or she can only write or broadcast with permission from the state (a warrant). This was so obvious that even while I was arguing about it, I felt it was surreal. I argued so forcefully about this that I almost blew Georg’s ears off. Where in the free world do journalists have state warrants?\\nNow, to my great and abiding horror, I discover after a long absence from the press conference scene that the DOI press card is serving a similar purpose. People are not allowed into press conferences given by pompous officials unless they have one – even if they work for the press. It is beyond ridiculous.\\nI have had the most terrible battles about this, but to my great disappointment, I find that instead of insisting that the DOI press card system, which crept up on us unawares, is done away with, the Institute of Journalists and the Committee of Journalists – two rival organisations that share a similar problem of being ridden with the employees of political parties – are helping to shore it up.\\nAnd so the Institute of Journalists, instead of protesting against the fact that a DOI press card is required for entry to Broadcasting Authority political press conferences, has protested that one such card was given to Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando ‘when it shouldn’t have been’. Yes, I agree that Jeffrey shouldn’t have been given a press card, but not for the reasons that the Institute of Journalists is making a fuss about. He didn’t need one because he is a member of parliament, and if a member of parliament – or anyone else for that matter – wishes to attend a press conference being given by the leader of the opposition, he should be free to do so. I can already see the question coming: how can we let everyone in?\\nBut of course we can, and of course we should. We’ve all seen the televised press conferences on international news channels. The rooms are packed, and you can rest assured that nobody is carrying a press card issued by the government. At most – if the person speaking is a global leader – they might have been issued with a security pass after showing proof of accreditation and identity. Are we now saying that when the leader of the opposition or the prime minister gives a press conference, we have to check journalists for bombs and machine-guns?\\nI think that the only reason the more unthinking journalists back up this system is because they imagine it gives them status. It is pointless my trying to explain that journalistic status comes only from the quality of your work, and not from your press card. The fact that I haven’t had a press card for around 15 years does not put me on a lower rung, work wise, than the Super One cameraman who has.\\nThere is a certain amount of insecurity among those who work for the media in Malta. There are many strange beliefs – for example, that you can’t hold a political opinion, or express it, if you are a journalist. The result is reams of newspaper columns and articles in which the writers attack everyone and praise no one so as to seem ‘independent’. In their book, independence, impartiality and sheer indifference are all confused.\\nDOI press cards\\nBut back to the DOI press cards. After the last general election, I went to the then prime minister’s press conference for no greater reason than to catch the mood. We were on track to joining the EU and it was an exciting moment. I wasn’t counting on the woman at the reception desk. ‘Ma tistax tidhol minghajr press card.’\\nShe asked for my name. There wasn’t even the merest flicker of recognition, which led me to conclude that she hadn’t read a single newspaper at any time in the previous 15 years – or listened to Super One. OK, I said – call the soldiers near the door. They’ll recognise me. And of course, they did. Soldiers tend to be good at this kind of thing.\\nStill that wasn’t enough, so I grabbed a copy of the previous Sunday’s edition that was conveniently lying around, flipped to my column and held it up to my face. There, you see? Still no joy – she had been given orders and by God, she was going to follow them to the letter. Then I brought out my identity card and matched the name to the name above the newspaper column. Look, it’s really me. No response – and I couldn’t get any aides because they were all buzzing around upstairs with their phones off.\\nSo I said, right, I’m going up anyway, and I crossed the courtyard, with the receptionist screaming at the soldiers to arrest me and the soldiers quite obviously unwilling to do so because they could see what a farce the whole thing was. Halfway up the stairs I met a junior aide, covered in embarrassment. The dumb receptionist had rung him in a panic to say that a woman without a press card called Daphne Caruana Galizia was making her way upstairs and the soldiers were refusing to cooperate in stopping her.\\nThe junior aide wanted to know why I didn’t have a press card. I explained that I refuse to hold a press card issued by the state, on principle, and it would be pretty pointless anyway, given that a press card is there to prove that you work for the press and roughly the entire country already knows that.\\nI am dismayed to see that the system hasn’t changed, that it has in fact become worse, and that journalists themselves are doing their best to encourage and maintain it, thinking that it is to their benefit when it is actually to their serious detriment.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nJoseph Abela posted this comment further along. I’m highlighting it because it’s so tragicomic. Lions of Change, Pigs of Change, DNA Mangion, Jason Robin, and now, the Smarmy Creep of Change – Latin lover Silvio Parnis, hair gelled within an inch of its life, handing out synthetic roses at the school gates in Tarxien. It just gets better and better (or worse and worse).\\nThis morning I took my nephew and niece to Tarxien Primary School and found quite a circus there. Silvio Parnis, his hair sculptured solid – qieshu mrewwha lest ghal zifna bil-kostum fi Pjazza Repubblika – fresh as a daisy and looking delirious with excitement, was handing out imitation red roses to all the mummies and grannies taking their kids to school. I am quite sure he was living an internal George Clooney moment. Such a delirium of grandiosity as cheesy Silvio struck the pose: ‘U din ghalik sinjura…Int taf li jien qatt ma tlabtek xejn, izda haqqni nitolbok il-vot ghal nhar is-Sibt. Ahseb fija.’\\nAll the women were dazed and confused at such a demonstration of gallantry. Many were caught without their best finery as track-suits and leggings were quite the fashion that morning. Many thought it was St. Valentine’s all over again. Others thought it’s Jum il-Mara already. Others just appeared numb at the sheer stupidity of the act. Many commented on the cheapness of the made-in-China rose. Some children cried ‘ghax riedu fjura ghat-teacher’. But the real nugget came when I went to buy my newspapers, and at the stationer’s there were two women with roses in their hands.\\nWoman 1:”U le ta, imma dan genn. Inzied fl-imbarazz jonqosni. Kelli skoss flower arrangements u kollox tajjart ‘l hemm! Ara, issa kif ser nghidlu lil Tony tieghi li Silvio gieni bir-rose fejn l-skola.”\\nWoman 2: “Aw u kemm ihossu! Jien hasadni gie bil-fjura. Madonna, ghidt jigu bil-video go wicci dalghodu – hrigt qisni il-mignuna mid-dar. Mur fehmu li m’ghandhiex grazzja mieghu daqs kemm narah falz. U kif kien baqa bl-storja tad-dar tax-xiha li seraq?”\\nWoman 1: “U fejn naf! Xbajt nisma paroli miz-zewgt nahat. Aw, ha nghidlek – hu u Jason min jippoza l-aktar. L-ghoqda ta’ l-ingravata qisha daqs dinja t-tnejn li huma. Balla n**k.”\\nWoman 2:”Isma, helu hux dak li beka hemm tan-Nigret (Mistra?). U iva, dak ta’ ghajnejh ta’ qattus, hemm – ta’ Gonzi….”.\\nWoman 1: “Jeffrey Pullicino Orland? Hiiiiii, u zgur li gustuz!”\\nEat your heart out, Silvio and Jason (not that Jason would bother much about this one). All the ladies want to cuddle Jeffrey and make him stop crying. Funny how long it’s taken some ‘men’ to find out that a single red rose inevitably has the opposite effect of that intended. Single red roses are associated in women’s minds with publicity stunts, cheap tricks, cheating husbands and importuning gypsies. Enough said.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThat’s the underlying argument to everything he is saying: that because he is the leader of a political party, he shouldn’t be treated like the rest of us. We have to fill in our VAT returns, we have to pay our fines if we don’t, but he doesn’t – because he’s Harry Vassallo, leader of AD. And since when is not having the money to pay your fine a valid excuse for not paying it? Try using that excuse the next time you get fined and see how far it will get you. Oh, but you’re not the leader of a political party that’s playing the victim, so you can’t call a press conference and make a fuss about it. You just have to ask your family to lend you the money and then hope you can pay them back.\\nI’m going to use the vernacular again here: sorry, ta – but isn’t this the political party that wants us to believe that it is a cut above the rest and ‘not like the MLPN’? Now here we have its leader, breaking the law and expecting special treatment because he is who he is. And when he doesn’t get that special treatment he calls a press conference, iziffen it-tfal fin-nofs, and tries to score brownie points (and avoid paying his dues) by playing the martyred victim. Why on earth isn’t his wife protecting her children from their father’s political opportunism? How indecent it is to expose those poor little children to the glare of public scrutiny and all that worry they must be feeling, just so that their father can play Poor Harry. It’s unforgivable. I would never have allowed my husband to do something like that – not that, thank God, he would ever have been so hellishly irresponsible, first mucking up his financial affairs and then using the children to pull in the sympathy vote.\\nWhy should Harry Vassallo get away with not paying his fines when there are hundreds of ordinary people out there who have had to pay theirs? This is just too much. Lots of people default on their payments or get fined for not filling in returns. The reason they don’t go to jail is because they pay their dues, even if they have to reach an agreement with the VAT Department to pay their dues by instalments. There have been amnesties since then which Vassallo could have used – but he obviously thinks he is too much of a cut above the rest to have to deal with the problems that we ordinary mortals have to put up with all the time, like filling in forms and dealing with bureaucrats. Why should he have to bother with all that? After all, he’s Poor Harry.\\nIf we have to pay our fines, then so does Harry Vassallo\\nVassallo clearly expects to be treated differently because he is the leader of a political party. What he is saying, in effect, is that he doesn’t want to pay the fines but he doesn’t want to go to jail either. Try doing that if you are not the leader of a political party, and see how far it will get you.\\nSome people, or so I have heard, have succeeded in having their sentences waived through a presidential pardon. Vassallo thought he would try to take advantage of this system. It didn’t work. He shouldn’t have tried in the first place. As the leader of a political party – particularly a political party that prides itself on being purer than the driven snow and different to all the rest – he should realise that he is in a different position to the man-in-the-street. He is in a position of responsibility. He has to be even more careful than the rest.\\nSo he broke the law (however unwittingly and however much we may sympathise with him for not putting his papers in order – we all know it’s a bloody bore) got fined, didn’t pay the fine, got a prison sentence, put in a plea for a presidential pardon, it didn’t work, and now he is kicking up a fuss and accusing the government of persecuting him. If he had got that presidential pardon, I imagine he wouldn’t have advertised the fact. And that’s where we realise that there’s nothing special or virginal about Harry Vassallo. He’s just another politician who’s looking after No. 1 and trying to get away with it.\\nAnd what about that presidential pardon?\\nNow here’s the thing that’s being overlooked. Pleas for presidential pardons go before the cabinet, or at least before the Minister of Justice, who must put in a recommendation to the president. This means that the cabinet knew about the AD leader’s problems with the law – but decently, they kept it quiet and didn’t leak the story to the press. They did so not because they had a hidden agenda but because decent men do not go about leaking stories about other politicians’ financial troubles. Vassallo himself is the one who leaked the story – and what’s more, he did so deliberately on the eve of an election when he thought it would serve the double purpose of helping him squirrel out of paying his dues while at the same time pulling in some ‘poor Harry’ votes.\\nHarry Vassallo has known about this for months. He lost one of those cases all the way back in 2005. Yes, he has had special treatment – very special treatment – because the authorities have bent over backwards to give him as much time as possible to pay what he owes. The police didn’t go to his home to arrest him. They went to his home to try to persuade him bil-kelma it-tajba that as the leader of AD and a public person, he should regularise his position. And Harry Vassallo seized on that and turned himself and his financial troubles into a public circus involving his poor, poor children. What a shame.\\nJust pay what you owe, Harry!\\nOK, so you can say that the bastard government could have recommended the AD leader’s plea for a pardon to the president, and didn’t do so for spiteful reasons. If you think this way, you’re not very imaginative and have poor knowledge of political strategy. If the government wanted to damn the AD leader once and for all, all it had to do was recommend him for a presidential pardon and then make it known that the AD leader’s fines for VAT irregularities had been pardoned by the president.\\nThe immediate effect among the electorate would be ‘Iss hej, the leader of a political party gets special treatment and I have to pay my fines.’ It wouldn’t exactly have helped Vassallo climb in the popularity stakes, and would have exposed him for what he is – just another politician looking after No. 1 and hoping that others don’t find out. If the government wanted to be really mean, it would have approved Vassallo’s presidential pardon, said nothing, and created a situation where it had ‘one over on him’ – a blackmail situation, if you will. It’s precisely because the government is made up of decent people (love them or hate them) that this wasn’t done. But I wouldn’t put it past a Labour government to do something like that – they seem to adore that kind of ghastly behaviour.\\nVassallo doesn’t have to go to prison, but he does have to pay his fines. If we have to pay ours, then he has to pay his. He’s got to cast around for the money, find it and pay it. That’s what you would have to do, and it’s what I would have to do. Vassallo has no right to expect special treatment or to cry foul if he doesn’t get treated better than the rest. Nobody wants him to go to prison, and the prison authorities have enough to cope with without finding room to house Harry Vassallo or the budget to keep him there for two years.\\nEnough of this drama already. Pay what you owe, Harry – it’s what the public expects of you.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nIn the course of this electoral campaign, Labour has put up a performance of tragicomedy that may reassure its hardcore supporters and leave others mildly bemused, but which makes the rest of us desperate in our anger that such behaviour is still possible.\\nAside from Alfred Sant’s brief propulsion to power on the back of an opportunistic promise to remove VAT in 1996, the Labour Party last won a clear electoral majority in 1976 – a full 32 years ago. Even in the election before that, in 1971, Dom Mintoff only reached the premiership on the strength of literally a handful of votes. Whoever those people were, they set in train a 16-year period of destruction, corruption and violence that eventually brought Malta to its knees, wrecked the economy and caused widespread civil unrest, pushing the country backwards while free Europe surged forwards, and handicapping us for years to come.\\nThirty-seven years later, the economic damage is undone, thanks to the exceptional efforts and ability of this government. While they are deserving of our criticism on several fronts – too churchy, not enough consideration given to the environment, a tendency to be indifferent to some people’s need for personal attention – they absolutely cannot be faulted on this one. And at the end of the day, it is what counts for most, because without a solid economy and high employment levels, there’s no time or money to be expended on the ancillaries.\\nFor those of my generation, who were forced to live shrunken lives deprived of all opportunity, there can be no going back and nothing can make up for what we lost. It would be nice to have some kind of apology from the Labour Party for what they did to us, but we’ll never hear anything of the sort. Alfred Sant has no regrets. To him, the difficult lives we had no choice but to lead are just so much water under the bridge.\\nUnforgivable\\nWhat is truly unforgivable is how he and the Labour Party, not satisfied with that mad, bad litany of serious misprints and malfunctions over 16 years, then tried to do the same to this generation of young people and all future generations to come. They fought hard to keep Malta out of Europe, and in so doing, to deny young people the EU citizenship that has set them free. Alfred Sant, like his Labour predecessors, knows only how to wreck and pillage. If Labour has the slightest bit of empathy for those whose lives it ruins or damages, then it doesn’t show it.\\nThe Labour Party is not fit to govern. It has never been fit to govern. Yet it hasn’t asked itself why, except for the fluke electoral victory that ended in the government’s collapse just 22 months later, it hasn’t won a single election since 1976, and won the one before that by just a few votes. The party permits no auto-criticism, instead silencing dissent and eliminating internal opponents with the determination of Josef Stalin. It has much the same approach to external criticism, going after those who mock or criticise with the equivalent of an army of tanks, searching and destroying. Not even booing, hissing students are safe.\\nLabour’s internal monitoring and quality control systems are so weak, or non-existent, that the party has been hijacked by a serial loser who is an electoral liability and a dangerous prospect for Malta.\\nHis was the first Maltese government to collapse since Independence. He couldn’t keep it together for longer than 22 months. He went on to lose two general elections and the single most important referendum in Maltese history. To top it all, he first claimed that he had won, and then insulted the entire population of Malta – those who voted No as well as those who voted Yes – by saying that he would ignore what they had to say. He’s still repeating the same thing today. He was booed so loudly at the university precisely because this is what he told the students: that he doesn’t acknowledge referendums, that he doesn’t care what they think.\\nLabour – no quality control\\nIf the Labour Party had those quality control mechanisms in place, Alfred Sant would have been put out to grass in 1998. The party allowed him to hang on and hijack the show in the same way that he became leader in 1992, in a process shrouded in mystery and laden with accusations. Instead, he remains here today after 10 solid years of losses, still saying he has no regrets, still insisting that we all look to the future like lemmings heading for the cliff-edge while ignoring his shocking past.\\nThose who support the Labour Party insist that it’s “their turn now”. They speak, incredibly, as though power is something that is owed to a political party on a rota basis, without the party having to do anything to deserve it, or to show that it is fit to govern. If that were the case, then we might as well do away with elections altogether, and just allow the two main parties to take five- or 10-year turns at the wheel.\\nThe Labour Party really has no understanding of what it means to govern. Like the less enlightened of its supporters, achieving the seat of government is an end in itself, rather than the means to the end of making Malta a better place to live. This is clear from everything the shadow cabinet says and does. We never hear them speak of their plans. We only hear them say Ha nkunu fil-gvern and La nkunu fil-gvern. What are they going to do then? They have no idea, and that’s why they have spent five weeks of the electoral campaign throwing mud and chucking insults about instead of telling us.\\nThe Nationalist Party has changed beyond recognition over the decades. It is not the same party it was in 1971; it is not even recognisable. But Labour remains unchanged. Sometimes you hear people saying, “Oh, but all the thugs have been removed.” I want to laugh and cry when I hear this. Labour expects praise because it removed its thugs? It shouldn’t have had those thugs in the first place. I’ll praise Labour if it enters the modern age, and becomes a party that is fit to run the country, and not because 16 years ago it removed a bunch of thugs for the cynical purpose of image-making.\\nThe Labour Party has singularly failed to adapt to changing times and changing circumstances. Its 60-year-old leader is still stuck in the early 1970s, repeating the discourse that would have been familiar to young people in 1968, but which is disengaged from contemporary reality. Everything the party does is inept, disorganised, inefficient, burdened by error and inadequacy. This is a political party which hopes to achieve government but which cannot put together even an electoral manifesto without a hundred mistakes which it then describes, futilely, as misprints and computer malfunctions.\\nIf Labour wins this election, it will be by default. It is not a party which inspires confidence in its ability to govern. Any new votes it claims it is attracting are negative votes – the votes of the people who want to punish this government for not giving them X, Y or Z, the votes of people who don’t particularly want anything for themselves, but who want to deprive others of what they perceive to be an unfair access to favourable networks. Schadenfreude is a strong driving force, but sadly, it takes just months for the pleasurable effect to wear off, and for regret and dissatisfaction to set in. And that’s why the Maltese rushed in their thousands to vote Sant out of power just 22 months after they had voted him in on a wave of glory and red flags.\\nLabour needs to clean out its house\\nThe Labour Party needs to clean out its house. If Alfred Sant wins this election, and because of the apathy, indifference and self-destructive spite of some he has a very good chance of doing so, it will be the worst thing that can possibly happen to Labour. The party will not be able to get rid of him then. It will not be able to set in train much-needed reform. It will not be able to begin the process by which it moves closer in structure, shape and modernity to the Nationalist Party. It will be finished. Winning this election will not be the renaissance of Labour, but its ultimate downfall. And many within the Labour Party know this, and resent being hoist by Alfred Sant’s petard.\\nGive us peace in our time\\nAs for what will become of Malta, it doesn’t even bear contemplation. Sant’s last stint in power was so bad that the newspaper headlines speak for themselves. Practically every organisation in this country was up in arms. There was worry, concern, brow-beating, panic, wonderment at the craziness of it all. The economy ground to a halt. Unemployment soared. What was it all for? Some people wanted to pay back a few other people. Some people wanted to remove VAT. It wasn’t worth it.\\nAnd even now, it just isn’t worth it either. A quiet life is beyond price.\\nThis article is published in The Malta Independent today.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe Police Commissioner has explained the train of events, and it looks like another case of MLPAD – now even the AD leader is twisting the truth.

The Commissioner explained that on October 15, 2007 the police received two arrest warrants issued by the Courts on September 27, 2007 against Dr Vassallo over unpaid fines which had been converted into a prison term. On October 18, 2007 the two warrants were sent to the Sliema police for execution. They were handed to the sergeant at Sliema police station on November 12 but were not executed. Since this sergeant was no longer posted at Sliema, on February 7 the warrants were handed to another sergeant. On March 1 this sergeant was involved in investigations into a burglary in Sliema. Since Dr Vassallo’s family had vacant property close to where the burglary took place, the sergeant, as was the norm, felt he needed to speak to Dr Vassallo to establish whether there was access from the Vassallo property to the property where the burglary took place.\\nAfter having phoned Dr Vassallo, the sergeant on Wednesday called on Dr Vassallo at his office. Once he was going there, the sergeant felt he should also speak to Dr Vassallo about the arrest warrants. According to the sergeant and the constable who accompanied him, they spoke to Dr Vassallo about their investigations into the burglary as well as the warrants. They asked Dr Vassallo to regularise his position instead of them having to proceed with the arrest as authorised by the court. The meeting had been a very cordial one and matters stopped there, the police said. Both the sergeant and the police constable categorically denied having communicated with a Media.link journalist or anybody else about the case. They also volunteered to make a sworn statement about the case. The Commissioner said he was asking the chairman of the Police Board, Judge Franco Depasquale, to hold an inquiry into the case.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOur feathered friend Alfred Sant morphed back into a cross between Lord Voldemort and Darth Vader yesterday evening and was busy beneath one of his wigwams, inciting yet another of his mobs into a mad frenzy against those who dare insist that the leader of AD pays his fine or serves his sentence.\\nAs the red-sweatered crowd screeched its appreciation, I sat and wondered at the mysterious ways in which people swallow this man’s application of two weights and two measures. On the one hand, he commissions books about l-iskandlu tal-Mistra and persecutes Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando. On the other hand, he defends the leader of a political party who breaks the law, doesn’t pay his fines, and then turns the matter into a media circus to avoid having to settle his dues.\\nIt’s the MLPAD all over again. If you’re going to be voting for any coalition, like Claire Bonello and Arnold Cassola keep telling you to do, this is the one you’ll get. As for me, I’ve had enough of self-serving truth-twisters.\\nRead this latest update from www.timesofmalta.com\\n\\nVassallo convicted twice – Court Registrar\\nThe Registrar of the Criminal Court, Paul Miruzzi, in a statement this afternoon explained how ‘conviction tickets’ were issued by the courts against AD leader Harry Vassallo after two convictions by the courts.\\nHe explained that on November 17, 2005 Dr Vassallo, as a person registered with the VAT Department, was arraigned before the Magistrates’ Court and accused of having failed to conform to a sentence against him handed down by the Magistrates’ Court on November 5, 2002. He was accused of having failed to obey a court order to comply with the law within two months, failing which he would be fined Lm6 for every day that the original fine remained unpaid. Dr Vassallo told the court that he was a lawyer and did not require legal counsel. After hearing the prosecution and Dr Vassallo and considering the evidence, the court condemned Dr Vassallo to pay Lm3,954. On August 3, 2007 the Registrar of the Criminal Courts was informed of a petition to the President, dated January 3, 2006, with regard to the court sentence. On September 18, 2007 the Registrar was informed that the petition had been turned down. On September 27, 2007 the Registrar issued a conviction ticket against Dr Vassallo and passed it on to the police for execution. On September 28, 2008 the courts had handed down another sentence against Dr Vassallo. Dr Vassallo had faced the same charges but over a different period of time. After considering the evidence, the court convicted Dr Vassallo and fined him Lm2,100. After having verified that there was no other plea for a presidential pardon, the registrar on September 27, 2007 issued another conviction ticket against Dr Vassallo and passed it on to the police for execution.\\nAnd Harry Vassallo loves a good lie-in\\nPink magazine interviewed the wives of the political party leaders, or least the three who have one. I decided that Mrs Vassallo should be given a medal for heroism, while her husband needs to be reminded that this is no longer the Victorian age. All the women in my family were struck by the same thing: Mrs Vassallo’s description of how she wakes up at 6am every day, rushes round cleaning, tidying, sorting things out and getting the children ready for school. Then at 8.30am she tiptoes into the bedroom with a cup of tea for Harry and wakes him to start his day, before she rushes off to earn the family bread. She rushes back from her job, cooks and shops, does some more tidying and sorting, and has everything spick and span and food on the table for the master of the house whenever he chooses to return from whatever he has been doing all day (knocking on the neighbours’ doors and telling them to vote for a coalition, probably).\\nAaaaarrrrghhhhhh! There, I’ve got that off my chest.\\nA few days later, I was reading some of Vassallo’s rubbish about family life, and how if AD is elected to the coalition government of his dreams, he will ensure that women have extended maternity leave. And I thought: what do you know about that, buster?\\nWhere I come from, it’s the men who wake up at the crack of dawn, bring their wives a cup of tea in bed, and then rush off to earn the family bread – especially if the wife is going to be busy earning some of it too. And they’re expected to pull their weight with the chores, or failing that, to pay somebody else to do so. In our neck of the woods, lazy men are not allowed.\\nIn the media circus surrounding his ‘fine or imprisonment’ problem, Vassallo squeaked in protest that if his sole source of income is Lm400 a month as leader of AD, he shouldn’t be expected to be able to pay Lm6,000. Try telling him that’s his problem, when he is so busy right now telling us that it’s ours. Hasn’t anyone ever told him that his first duty is towards his wife and children, not towards himself and politics? I can understand that he is too busy to work and earn money in an electoral campaign, but there isn’t much to keep the leader of a political party (without a single seat in parliament) occupied for the other four years and nine months. So how does he spend his time, while his wife cooks, cleans, earns money, shops for food and looks after the children? Sleeping (another thing he has in common with Alfred Sant)? Reading (ditto)? Writing propaganda articles (ditto)? Trying to convince his neighbours of the wisdom of a coalition government? At least Alfred Sant has some chickens to feed in a coop at the end of his garden (feathered friends for our feathered friend).\\nHarry Vassallo’s lifestyle is beyond my comprehension, but that’s because I am unnaturally prejudiced against men who allow their wives to work much, much harder than they do, running around in circles trying to keep a hundred balls up in the air while their husbands float around and dream. Perhaps in this I am sexist, because I am not similarly prejudiced against women who float around and dream while their husband works his socks off (though I do think they are a bit of a waste of space). But there’s something that bothers me a lot about a man who lets a woman lift far more than her fair share of the burden. It doesn’t ring right.\\nVassallo’s excuse that he can’t work because he’s too busy with AD strikes me as the false protest of the shirker. There are lots of politicians who are far, far busier than he is in their political work, but who still succeed in holding down their day job. This may not be ideal, and in several cases it leads to conflict of interest, but that’s only because they have a parliamentary seat – and Vassallo does not. There is no conflict of interest involved for him. Besides, I use this only as an example that, if you are a hard-working man and not a lazy one, you’ll work all the hours God sends to provide for your children and even for your wife if she is looking after them, and still have time for your political hobbies or even your political work. After all, Vassallo is in a more privileged position than most, because he has a profession which allows him to be self-employed and to make his own hours. He doesn’t have to answer to a boss or be a salaried man at the office between 9am and 5pm.\\nInstead of sleeping until his wife wakes him at 8.30am with a cup of tea every day, Harry Vassallo should have been filling in some forms.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n“Jaghzluna mhux skond kemm ahna kapaci nhammgu, imma kemm ahna kapaci nwettqu ghal kulhadd” – Lawrence Gonzi tells Alfred Sant where to put his obsession with korruzzjoni. The final debate between the two leaders is aired tonight at 2030hrs on TVM.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nOr at least, that’s what Lawrence Gonzi told him in the final debate on TVM earlier tonight. Meanwhile, Squawking Sant went diligently through his list of phrases-which-I-must-use-every-time-I-speak-in-public. Good governance. Korruzzjoni lampanti. Bidla trankwilla. Stil modern ta’ tmexxija. Kafe jew tnejn. Stagnar.\\nThen he brought out his list of reasons why we should vote Labour for a bidla trankwilla. Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and his tenant at Mistra. A health report on the government website that lists ‘miscellaneous fees’ (the fees paid by those who are not Maltese or British). A four-year-old report about health payments rejected by Gonzi with the words ‘Over my dead body.’ Oh yes, and his latest one: Malta is now the Ukraine of the Mediterranean because Harry Vassallo refused to pay his VAT fines and fill in his VAT forms and he now risks imprisonment.\\n‘You’ve got a nerve, you weirdo,’ I yelled at the television. ‘And were the hell where you in 1985? Oh yes, you were president of the corrupt, hellish and violent Labour Party. Ghax ma’ tmurx tinheba!’\\nTalk about reinventing himself – this man has some brass neck to even mention the word ‘corruption’. I wish Gonzi had had the presence of mind to remind Sant exactly where he was when the Labour Party had turned Malta into the Zimbabwe of the Mediterranean. I would have loved to hear him reply (robotic voice): ‘I don’t talk about history. That’s water under the bridge.’\\nSo what did he say that was exciting enough to tempt me to vote Labour? Don’t hold your breath: nothing but more neurotic obsessing about korruzzjoni lampanti – a field in Mistra and a pavement outside Ninu Zammit’s house. Yes, I really can’t wait until Saturday to rush to the polling-station to give them my Number One.\\nA mistake that will go down in history\\nWhat I remember most from the final debate between Squawking Sant and Eddie Fenech Adami in 2003 was the sound of Sant heckling Fenech Adami as the credits rolled. This time, he did all his heckling at the start of the show. Gonzi was trying to explain something, and all I could hear was The Feathered One clucking and squawking and interrupting while the moderator made no attempt at stopping him.\\nGonzi was on top form, speaking for many of us when he told Sant about his visit to the Police Commissioner: ‘Allura filghaxija tghidlu ‘paraventu’, imbaghad filghodu tmur ghandu u tiehu l-gazzetti mieghek halli taghmel show. L-aqwa l-show, mhux ir-rapport.’\\nI wish the camera had panned to Sant’s face when Gonzi told him that his mistake of refusing to join the European Union would go down in history: ‘a historic mistake.’ This really must have bitten deep, because Sant believes that he was born to lead Malta, destined to become the greatest prime minister in the history of the country – and at 60, an age when most are looking back at their achievements, he is still hoping to achieve this dream, with the rest of us paying the price.\\nHall of mirrors\\nWell, you have to hand it to our feathered friend. He really knows how to distort reality. One of my sons (the one who rightly told the Super One harasser where to go and how to do it) emerged from his bedroom bug-eyed in wonder at the sound of The Feathered One’s bleating about how Malta is stagnating, how ‘taht GonziPN il-pajjiz mar lura.’\\n‘Is he mad?’ he asked. ‘I’m the wrong person to ask because I’m not a psychiatrist,’ I said. ‘Let’s just conclude that he’s partly deaf and blind and has a distorted view of reality.’ The ‘son of Daphne’ went back to his bedroom, another first-time voter who’s turned his back on the clucking chicken.\\nSant also has a whole list of petty obsessions, like not calling the new hospital by its name. ‘L-isptar tal-Qroqq,’ he keeps saying, and this time Gonzi corrected him off camera: ‘Mater Dei jismu.’ Then he launched into a description of why he thinks Malta is a worse place now than it was when he was running the country (into the ground). Off camera, I could hear Gonzi sigh with exasperation: ‘U Giezu, minn fejn igibhom; x’affarijiet dawn.’\\nYes, really – x’affarijiet dawn. We have got to this stage – an electoral contest between the man who has worked wonders in four years and a cowardly weirdo in a wig who calls his mummy when students boo him, whose government collapsed in chaos after 22 months, and who has lost two general elections and one referendum. And we don’t know which one will win. That’s the real obscenity.\\nGodard Pastizzerija – Prop. A. Sant\\nFor the best qassatat in town, check out this link.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThe mass meetings are on Super One and Net as I write this – two tribes, except that one tribe is grimly massing for war and the other tribe is having a giant party. And no, it’s not just the poor quality of the filming on Super One and all those red pennants that make me think the crowd looks tensed up for battle.\\nI’d actually forgotten – unbelievably – that there are mass meetings on the final day of the campaign, and so last Sunday I watched the rather deflated exercise on the Granaries and thought, oh well. Meanwhile, on Super One, Alfred Sant’s rag-tag army was gearing up for war, with Sant himself making Hitlerian-type speeches from the stage, with all the modernity of a 1930s demagogue. It wasn’t a happy sight, either – not at all.\\nToday was different on the Granaries, though not at the old military parade ground. I set great store by the final meetings, because they are the culmination of the entire five weeks of campaigning, and sum up the spirit of the campaign. So this evening I have different thoughts. The atmosphere on the Granaries is joyful – not the joy of power or the joy of victory or even the joy of spiting others. No, it’s the joy of positive thinking. This time, it’s the crowd at the former parade ground that seems uncertain.\\nLabour mass meetings of the past few years have invariably been negative, but this one is doubly so. I’m not surprised the crowd feel and look that way, forced as they are to listen to angry speaker after angry speaker, all of them with grim expressions, never a smile, never a word of hope or faith, but only the promise that soon il-gvern ikun taghna u naghmlu festa.\\nAlfred Sant tries to smile\\nAlfred Sant did try to smile. He must have registered my description of the lot of them as cross vultures and a deathly funeral procession, and so on the stage his stiff face did a little bit of cracking but it just didn’t look convincing. He and his sidekick Jason have the appearance of a couple of shady cheats who are trying to sell me something I don’t want or need, that has no guarantee and will break down after a couple of days. All they need is a checked suit and bow-tie and the picture is complete.\\nBzonn ta’ bidla\\nLabour being the slick and professional outfit that it is, the stage backdrop at the mass meeting was perfectly chosen: BZONN TA’ BIDLA written in HUGE letters just behind the main speaker, a certain Alfred Sant. I’m sure that a thousand people were telling their televisions that they couldn’t agree more.\\nFor the final week of Labour’s ‘campaign’, the slogan Bidu Gdid has become Bzonn ta’ Bidla. Yes, that’s right. Get him out of the way immediately, and then perhaps things will start happening.\\nOver on Net, Lawrence Gonzi was in fighting form. What a relief – he’s been looking a little beaten down over the past few days. Faced by thousands upon thousands of young people he was in his element. On the whole, young people don’t relate to Alfred Sant – he’s like a stiff old grandfather who’s lost touch with the new generation. And quite frankly, if I were 18 I would be dead embarrassed to be associated with a creepy guy in a wig who never smiles, never laughs, can’t get his act together, stomps around in a funereal procession with a pretty-boy and a couple of extras from a New York Italian gangster film, and did his utmost to keep me out of the European Union. It’s funny how Squawking Sant has no regrets about any of this.\\nListening to Gonzi was cathartic for me. ‘Hekk, hekk, say it, tell him!’ I yelled from the comfort of my sofa, being too wiped out to hike over to Floriana. Then I flicked over to Super One and booed and hissed to my heart’s delight, making rude noises with my lips for good measure and throwing in a couple of reverse salutes for fun. I would have thrown rotten tomatoes, too, but then I would have been the one to clean up the mess, so I didn’t. And you should have heard how many times I said ***k off too. And ***hole. And w**ker. And worse. If that ‘tobby’ with the camera from Super One were there, he would have had a field-day, and so would Miss Miriam Dalli, head of Super One News, who is currently providing entertainment for the nation (you sow the wind, Miss Dalli, and you reap the whirlwind).\\nAntennae in lipstick\\nOne of my sisters painted antennae in lipstick around Squawking Sant’s head on the television screen, a process made simpler by the fact that once he takes up a position, he doesn’t move – ‘to make watching him more amusing,’ she said, ‘otherwise I just have to fight the urge to slap the television.’ I told her she should have just switched him off. But here’s the thing, you see: watching him is creepily addictive.\\nWhat does Squawking Sant have to offer us? Nothing. Ask him why we should vote Labour and he has no answer. That’s why the T-shirt with the slogan ‘Nivvota Labour? Inz**bab!’ has been such a knock-out best-seller. It sums up the popular sentiment perfectly. I have to hand it to the Maltese language: it’s very expressive at times.\\nKorruzzjoni Lampanti Sant\\nBack over on Net, Gonzi was asking why on earth we should choose to leave the country in the hands of somebody who doesn’t even have the guts to face an audience of students, and who runs out to send in his tanks (my choice of words) when they boo him for being a prat.\\nGonzi’s messages of hope contrasted heavily with Korruzzjoni Lampanti Sant’s messages of gloom and doom. Unbelievably, he was using his very last hours of campaigning to continue ranting and raving about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando – something DNA Mangion had already done before him (with the requisite death-mask expression) and the mention of ‘miscellaneous fees’ in a health services report that is readily available on the government website.\\nVote Labour because a Nationalist MP’s tenant applied to the MEPA to develop a field? Is that the best you can do? Inz**bab. I’m sorry to be crass, but no polite words fit this particular bill. How did we end up with an Opposition party that’s little more than a giant freak show? This man’s idea of campaigning is to shout negative messages, rant on about a field in Mistra, and wave old-hat documents around, while obsessing about korruzzjoni lampanti. You should know all there is to know about corruption, Mr President Of The MLP in 1984.\\nThe latest update on Please-Jail-Me Harry\\nThis report came from www.timesofmalta.com before it was taken off line due to the blanket ban on political reporting.\\n“The Finance Ministry said this afternoon that contrary to what was claimed yesterday by Alternattiva Demokratika leader Harry Vassallo, according to the Registry of Companies the company Abelweld Ltd still existed and Dr Vassallo was shown as being its majority shareholder, director, company secretary and the person legally responsible for the company.”\\n“It was not the case, therefore, that Dr Vassallo no longer represented the company, as he claimed yesterday. Therefore, the ministry said, when Dr Vassallo informed the VAT Department that he was no longer responsible, he was misleading the department.”\\n“The ministry said that a presidential pardon could not be given to Dr Vassallo because he was refusing to fill in the 37 VAT returns covering the period for which the courts found him to be legally responsible and guilty. Dr Vassallo, however, was still in time to regularise his position by filling in the VAT forms for the years at issue so that his plea for a pardon could be considered.”\\n“The ministry also published the report of the VAT Commissioner on the case. In his report the VAT commissioner said Dr Vassallo registered the company for VAT purposes on September 29, 1994. The company did not submit VAT returns between August 1, 1999 and July 31, 2005. It sent one return in 1999 but failed to file the other 37 due to date. After several warnings, legal action was instituted by the police. The police sued Dr Vassallo as the person responsible under the law and he was arraigned on November 2002, convicted and fined Lm100 and Lm6 for every day that he failed to settle the fine.”\\n“Since Dr Vassallo did not follow the court’s orders, fresh legal action was instituted in November 2005. Dr Vassallo was again found guilty and fined a total of Lm3,954 covering the period January 2003 to October 2004. Dr Vassallo was arraigned again in May 2005 on similar charges, convicted once more and again fined Lm100. Since he did not submit the returns, Dr Vassallo was again arraigned in September 2006 and fined Lm2,100.”\\n“In January 2006 Dr Vassallo requested a presidential pardon but since the returns were still not submitted, the request was denied. The commissioner said Dr Vassallo was still a major shareholder of the company Abelweid Limited as well as director and legal representative.”\\nThey’re promising a 20,000 landslide victory for Labour\\nYes, and they’re also promising to strike oil when they’re in government. The leader of the Opposition, who lays eggs and clucks in his spare time, said when asked under one of his wigwams whether Malta would find oil: ‘Ghaliex le? Konvint.’ Then he promised to ask for the resignation of Joe Mizzi, the silly sod who was Minister Without Portfolio in Sant’s last cabinet and who is earmarked as Minister for Oil this time round, if oil is not struck.\\nThe story has been spun for Labour supporters that a 20,000 landslide victory is on the cards. The last time I remember a story so stupid and irresponsible was in 1996, when it was put about that the Nationalists were expecting a landslide victory by 16,000 votes. Well, we all know what happened then.\\nIn raising supporters’ expectations so high, Labour’s leaders are setting themselves up for a big fall should they lose. There is no way they can win by a landslide, but they do have a good chance of winning by default, and in that case, nobody is going to say ‘Look, you promised us 20,000 and we only won by 2,000’. A win is a win is a win, and nobody will be doing any nitpicking.\\nIf Labour loses, it’s different. Promising supporters a win is a big risk. Promising a landslide victory is an even greater gamble. The higher expectations are pushed, the sorer the losers are, and then those who made reckless promises are blamed and whipped for it. It would have been wiser for the Labour leaders to say nothing, or to keep expectations safely lower. Ah, but that’s too much to expect. The Labour leader is a chicken, but those around him have chicken-brains if they haven’t worked this one out.\\nPlaying for high stakes\\nThey’re playing for very, very high stakes indeed – their political lives. Squawking Sant has not a hope in hell of sitting tight through yet another electoral loss. His deputies will go down with him, even though the bawling Lion of Change is already elbowing his way in. If Labour chooses him as leader, then Labour is truly insane. It has long needed a leader who appeals to the middle classes – sane, safe, no class hatred seeping out of every pore, no vicious language or vile behaviour, no posturing instead of policies. The Lion of Change will be just a throw-back to Dom Mintoff, but without the brains. The man can buy himself all the swimming-pools in the world but he’ll never have any style, and his mental horizons remain limited to santi tal-Madonna fil-but, fireworks, the Stella Maris festa, yodelling at mass meetings, screeching inanities, and hunting in Romania.\\nIt struck me over the course of this campaign that though the single biggest issue is the economy, the underlying issue is class hatred and suspicion of The Other. I have never felt so much class hatred over the last few general elections as I have in this campaign. What’s most interesting is that the class hatred is one way only: those who have a chip on their shoulder about their origins hating those who they think are privileged, well-connected, well-born, blessed with this, that or the other.\\nI had thought all this was dead and buried with Mintoff’s days, but apparently it’s not. The Labour leaders have tapped into it, and have played it for all it’s worth throughout the campaign. Incitement of class hatred is what underpins all those remarks about xi haga hazina fid-DNA, George Vella’s hysterical rabble-rousing speech about students who come from privileged backgrounds, Alfred Sant’s constant winding up of people to get them to think that they are the have-nots and that the haves have run off with more than their fair share, and all the rest of it.\\nWhat perplexes me most is that the kind of class hatred that Dom Mintoff engendered still survives today, even though everyone is so much better off and education and good career opportunities are accessible to all who want them. Mintoff created a monster that just won’t go away. Parked outside the Labour meeting at Luxol last Sunday there were hundreds of really expensive cars, including giant SUVs which cost almost as much as a small flat. And yet the people who drove them to the old military parade ground to listen to an incompetent and hate-driven has-been rabble-rouse and incite hatred still feel they’re not the real McCoy. They still feel they’re outside the game, that they’re not quite good enough, that the way to get to the top is by shoving aside those who they think were born privileged and trampling on their heads to show them who’s the boss.\\nNo matter how much money they earn, and even if they earn 10 times as much as the tal-pepe person down the road, they will always feel they are not quite good enough, and Korruzzjoni Lampanti Sant and that absolutely horrible George Vella encourage them in this.\\nLawrence Gonzi wonders out loud why Labour is always preaching negativity, jealousy and discouragement, why it tells its supporters that they are not good enough. Here’s the answer why: because as soon as people shed their innate inferiority complex or their bitter hang-ups they no longer want to be associated with a bunch of inadequate losers. There are some exceptions, yes – smart, chip-free people who support Labour – but truly, they are the exceptions who prove the rule, the swallows that don’t make the summer.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nDo you really expect us to vote for you tomorrow, on the 5th anniversary of the day you told us that you don’t care what we think? And after you told us that you have no regrets for claiming that partnership won, no regrets for telling us that you still don’t acknowledge the referendum result, and no\\nregrets for brushing our wishes aside? You must be joking.\\n\\nThese photographs were taken by Florence-based photographer Daniel Cilia at the Nationalist Party mass meeting yesterday evening.\\nChoose the man best fit to be prime minister\\nHere’s last night’s debate between Gonzi and Sant.\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT: Debate 2008 (Part 1)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT: Debate 2008 (Part 2)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 3)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 4)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 5)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 6)\\nLAWRENCE GONZI VS ALFRED SANT : Debate 2008 (Part 7)\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:05 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:06 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:06 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:06 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:07 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:07 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis entry was posted on Friday, March 7th, 2008 at 11:07 am and is filed under .\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nSomebody called David Camilleri, who has an AD-Ghawdex Internet address, but who is emailing everyone to tell them to vote Labour to bring down the Nazi government, has a fresh bee buzzing in his bonnet. This is animal rights. Apparently, we should vote Labour because Alfred Sant loves animals and Lawrence Gonzi doesn’t.\\nI don’t know where he got this one. What’s the proof that Squawking Sant loves animals – the fact that he keeps a clutch of chickens in his backyard? Maybe he keeps them because there’s a fellow-feeling between them. I’d like to see him handle the curious advances of a sniffing dog: ‘Tmissnix, jekk joghgbok.’ Mr I’m-so-frozen-I-chilled-the-EU-application-by-slipping-it-into-my-underpants will probably run a mile at the first approach of somebody else’s drooling pet. I watched him on television trying to chat to a pig in a Gozitan sty, and I must say I wasn’t very impressed. The pig wasn’t impressed either: check out this link and see for yourself.\\nGonzi famously works through his documents at home with his cat wrapped round his shoulders. (I’m not a big cat fan, but I find dogs incredibly amusing because they have distinct personalities.) I can’t imagine Sant allowing a cat – or any other living thing, for that matter – to take up a similar position: ‘Tmissnix, jekk joghgbok.’ There is all that cat-hair to consider, and the road-kill headgear might be dislodged.\\nSeriously, though – whether people love animals, dislike them or are indifferent to them doesn’t say much about their character or personality. Hitler was a great animal-lover. Too bad he hated human-beings. The only attitude towards animals that says a lot about a person is sadism or cruelty towards them. You can read a lot into that. People who are kind to animals are not necessarily kind to humans, but people who are sadistic to animals are invariably sadistic to humans too.\\nSo let’s leave aside the issue of who loves animals more – Sant with his chicken-friends, or Gonzi with his Qattusa – and consider instead which one of them has given proper consideration to animals in his electoral programme.\\nLawrence Gonzi (commitments taken from the Nationalist Party’s electoral programme)\\n176. Work will continue on the animal protection centre in Ta’ Qali, given that all the necessary permits and calls for tender submissions have been issued, and the plans completed.\\n177. There will be more measures for the protection of animals, with increased involvement of NGOs in, among other things, the development of a centre of for animal rehabilitation and care.\\n178. There will be a training programme for animal sanctuary staff, and the programme of voluntary secondment of government employees to animal sanctuaries will continue.\\n179. There will be a micro-chipping programme for dogs and other domestic animals.\\n180. A rehabilitation centre for wild animals, such as tortoises, birds and dolphins, will be set up at Xrobb l-Għaġin and Delimara with funds from Norway.\\n181. There will be a foundation to coordinate animal-related projects.\\nAlfred Sant (commitments fished out from amid the misprints and computer malfunctions in the Labour Party’s electoral programme)\\n15. A sanctuary for animal welfare will be established in six months.\\n16. Hunting and trapping will be regulated WITH THE AIM OF SUSTAINING THIS PRACTICE. This will have to be done in the light of the legal obligations of the EU as they are interpreted today, but also in the best interests of the protection of the natural environment of our country. THIS WILL BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF OUR COUNTRY.\\nWell, the Lion of Change hunts in Romania\\nOnly a political party with a deputy leader who goes hunting in Romania would make one of the only two commitments on animals in the electoral manifesto a pledge to sustain shooting and trapping birds. And only a party run by I-hate-Europe Alfred Sant would put in a Great Big Escape Clause like ‘this will be done with respect to the geographic and demographic aspects of our country’ when committing himself to respect the ruling from Europe.\\nAs for Labour’s animal sanctuary – l-aqwa s-‘six months’. The surcharge will be halved in six days and the animal welfare sanctuary will be established in six months. What, complete with project over-runs of 250%? Or maybe he’s going to get I-switched-to-Labour-to-get-my-perit-warrant-without-sitting-my-exams Martin Debono to oversee this mammoth task, so that we might end up with something that took as long as the Bugibba promenade.\\nAs my friends down at Malta’s already existing dog, horse and cat sanctuaries have pointed out, Malta doesn’t need more animal sanctuaries. What Malta needs is a programme to teach people responsible pet ownership and the importance of neutering. Opening up more animal sanctuaries without this public information campaign or neutering programme is like opening up more and more orphanages under Ceaucescu and his ban on birth control.\\nHave you ever seen Clucking Chicken Sant being pawed by a dog? That’s right – I can’t picture it either. He would probably pass out: ‘Tmissnix, jekk joghgbok.’ But if anyone has a link, please send it in.\\n“Ix-xemx hamra hanina Laburista titla fuq il-pajjiz”\\n– il-pojeta Michael Falzon, l-iljun tal-bidla\\nIf you’re at work right now, gather your colleagues around you, click on this link, and turn up the volume. Yes, I know it will affect productivity, but what the hell. I don’t think many people are in work mode today – probably not even the boss (especially not the boss, as the spectre of Darth Vader the Chicken looms large).\\n\\n  \\n'"
