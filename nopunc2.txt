Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning as did the Prime MinisterÄôs More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past he says heÄôll leave it to the historians to decide because as far as heÄôs concerned itÄôs all water under the bridge and he has no regrets And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour governmentÄôs corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid1980s And those were the days when you couldnÄôt report it to the Commissioner of Police because not only was he a ÄòparaventuÄô for corruption in the real sense of the word but his men were not to be trusted LetÄôs say that this is some kind of act of redemption on SantÄôs part Äì protesting too much now because he didnÄôt protest enough or at all then
He doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions Maybe thatÄôs why throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question What do you plan to do if you become prime minister
Now we know why he doesnÄôt tell us his plans He doesnÄôt deal in hypotheses So he doesnÄôt answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical and he doesnÄôt answer questions about the past because itÄôs all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge That doesnÄôt leave much for an interviewer to be going on with which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewerÄôs least favourite subject Äì except for the lovely Simone Cini that is because she isnÄôt exactly out to give him a good grilling
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister For those who donÄôt know him this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould He had Äì still has but he is retired now Äì the inscrutability of a dowager duchessÄôs butler and the allperceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister A civil servant since colonial times he did everything with perfect correctness You can imagine just how well he got along with Äòbazwar Äòl hawn bazwar Äòl hemmÄô Sant LetÄôs just say that it wasnÄôt love at first sight or at second sight either
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister Interestingly Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasnÄôt water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service
A few days later Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and unshackled by the Estacode spilt the beans on Sant in an article called Äì donÄôt you just love it Äì ÄúNothing but untruthsÄù I couldnÄôt have put it better myself So I read on until I came to the last paragraph which IÄôll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up The Times 29 February
ÄúI have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates I shall not elaborate further in that regard His selfdeclared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir Äòl hemm u ftit tbazwir Äòl hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen and to all others It is selfevident that with Dr Sant at the helm Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster In contrast Lawrence GonziÄôs outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime ministerÄù
If Sant owned a television set he famously does not he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes Minister and learn some useful lessons the most useful of which is this never cross Sir Humphrey
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30yearold Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille
ÄòAlfred Sant Äì IlVizjoni ghallBidlaÄô is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc talbidla at waiting hordes of admirers I canÄôt imagine who might buy it except people like me who want a good giggle because itÄôs the most embarrassing sort of hagiography Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung Äì though of course Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words translated from the Maltese ÄúAfter he finished his studies in Paris he went to America to study at the best university Harvard where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studiedÄù The English translation is deliberately clumsy to reproduce the full effect of the original
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then
No wonder he makes such a hash of things because as far as I can discern from this hagiography he never took a refresher course
Ah but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto
ÄúAlfred Sant IlVizjoni GhallBidla is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Written by novelist Frans Sammut it is an intimate portrait of a highbrow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa That won the Broadcasting AuthorityÄôs TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr SammutÄôs critical eye The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained perhaps for the first time Dr SantÄôs philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writerpolitician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed detailsÄù
Those of you who have been led up the gardenpath by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed There is no sex in this book
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign To do this they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures Maybe thatÄôs why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on Äì for if he canÄôt blind us with facts and figures what can he do Oh he can talk about DNA instead or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter whoÄôs just asked him about the Gozo incinerator while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder ÄúMur xommuÄù
On Super One the other day Norman Hamilton the shadow minister of finance the wouldbe prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ÄògrantÄô to firsttime homebuyers Except that itÄôs not a grant of course but a loan Äì because if and when you sell the property you have to pay the government back with interest Astonishingly they didnÄôt mention the word ÄòeurosÄô once even though youÄôd think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money he speaks about liri for all the world as though 1 January hadnÄôt come and gone LabourÄôs electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the partyÄôs state of denial about the euro The bit about subsidised loans to firsttime homebuyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50000 a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007 but which gives us the rather odd figure of Ç¨116500 now When explaining LabourÄôs houseloans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices Sant said ÄúWhoever sets the price at Lm56000 would consider selling at Lm49000 or Lm50000 to qualify under the schemeÄù
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good He isnÄôt trying very hard to embrace the euro now is he
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read ÄòLabour will respect European CourtÄôs rulingÄô The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists We expect too little from Labour and thatÄôs precisely what we get
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies the Lion of Change and Charlie ÄòDNAÄô Mangion tell us that they will get the best out of Europe Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt of dire trepidation Maybe itÄôs because IÄôm a shallow person but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache I canÄôt imagine the Lion of Change fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church his lucky santa talMadonna safely in his pocket heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats
Picture the same delegation that is now making pitstop tours of villages on the kowc talbidla piling onto the flight to Brussels faces grimly and determinedly set ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant Alla Hares Jitilghu lPagi Vella and the Lion of Change Embarrassing doesnÄôt even begin to describe it
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997 when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET He had already been in power for a year and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semihysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with MaltaÄôs taxation problem frozen application and all they still had to deal with the EU The minute he found out I was Maltese and that I didnÄôt like the government he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax It was spot on and there I was torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits one of whom read out a longwinded speech at the negotiatingtable
Bugeyed on strong espressos my coffeebar acquaintance demanded of me ÄúWhy is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient systemÄù I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it and a cunning plan to replace it instead And out came the rejoinder ÄúWhy did your people choose such a manÄù
I didnÄôt know the answer to that one I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and that in 1987 with all that killing corruption violence and fear the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell who wears a lapelbutton claiming that Enoch Powell was right is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ÄònitnejkuÄô and Äòjiehduh fÄôghajnhomÄô in his speeches another party leader in a wig the most recent model displaying goldengrey streaks and highlights yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest Emy of the Alpha Party and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety
ÄúIÄôm contesting so that when weÄôve been completely invaded by immigrants this cowardly people even though sincere will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend themÄù he explained The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at At least 1600 people voted for him in the MEP elections
Next to this lot of rival party leaders Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane I think IÄôll vote for him
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one whether we want to or not What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me Like the members of a cult AD are working at persuading the gullible through the use of jargon and emotive ideals that 1 a coalition government is possible and 2 it is desirable rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country AD jumps out of the woodwork and says but what about Germany Yes what indeed Germany is now in a huge mess Äì as the New Left of postGDR communists come to the fore traditional coalitions are ruled out leaving a swamp of uncertainty
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92 of the vote There is simply no scope for coalition here even if those parties wanted it and Alfred Sant as we know doesnÄôt discuss hypothetical questions Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party This means that Nationalist seats in the partyÄôs traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003 when there was a strong vote for Europe let alone now with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats In this case a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament If a third party gets a seat it doesnÄôt Things stay as they are This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into SantÄôs lap even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party and we will have a rerun of 1981
Even if AD doesnÄôt gain a seat it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own but as a sort of Junior PN Äì which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government So I ask if these people donÄôt mind a Labour government why donÄôt they just vote for it in the first place And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister because they prefer him to Sant why arenÄôt they deploying common sense and voting for his party instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those proEU Labour supporters who in 2003 voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope It just doesnÄôt make sense
You canÄôt take AD seriously in any case not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this ÄúFrom where I stand having Dr Sant as prime minister in a singleparty government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another singleparty governmentÄù Äì Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him
Labour United
When the members of Alfred SantÄôs shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leaderÄôs myriad qualities and his robust strength what they convince us of and probably also Sant himself is not their loyalty but their fear Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them
Throughout this election campaign Sant has gone about as part of a huddle not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities he is halfburied in wouldbe ministers all pressing into the camera shot They look absolutely ridiculous as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone Äì just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him Each time Sant was upset to see him and fell back on some secondary subject Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry he launched into a tirade against him When a reporter asked him on camera why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements he just smirked
Bullies are cowards really but we learned that at school If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando he would have no problem staring him down while saying it It is only when we lie about people or lie to them that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening Sant doesnÄôt want his victims shouting ÄòLiarÄô from the back of the crowd so he avoids them ÄúOnly journalists are invited to my press conferencesÄù he said Oh really I didnÄôt know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra or to approach the gates of the MEPA
Sant does the same with the prime minister This morning seemingly halfcut on his podium in Gozo though it was so early in the day he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldnÄôt give a single one He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddytrain Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar but he canÄôt say it to his face HeÄôs much too lilylivered and he knows it isnÄôt true The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isnÄôt true Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language the unspoken messages that come through delivery posture and behaviour And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when theyÄôre being liberal with the truth and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders IÄôd like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then I would think that he doesnÄôt have what it takes The trouble is that Sant canÄôt bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does even among people who are voting Labour
He lost our trust a long time ago and heÄôs not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc talbidla flinging excrement at the fan

When the members of Alfred SantÄôs shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leaderÄôs myriad qualities and his robust strength what they convince us of and probably also Sant himself is not their loyalty but their fear Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them
Throughout this election campaign Sant has gone about as part of a huddle not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities he is halfburied in wouldbe ministers all pressing into the camera shot They look absolutely ridiculous as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone Äì just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him Each time Sant was upset to see him and fell back on some secondary subject Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry he launched into a tirade against him When a reporter asked him on camera why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements he just smirked
Bullies are cowards really but we learned that at school If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando he would have no problem staring him down while saying it It is only when we lie about people or lie to them that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening Sant doesnÄôt want his victims shouting ÄòLiarÄô from the back of the crowd so he avoids them ÄúOnly journalists are invited to my press conferencesÄù he said Oh really I didnÄôt know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra or to approach the gates of the MEPA
Sant does the same with the prime minister This morning seemingly halfcut on his podium in Gozo though it was so early in the day he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldnÄôt give a single one He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddytrain Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar but he canÄôt say it to his face HeÄôs much too lilylivered and he knows it isnÄôt true The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isnÄôt true Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language the unspoken messages that come through delivery posture and behaviour And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when theyÄôre being liberal with the truth and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders IÄôd like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then I would think that he doesnÄôt have what it takes The trouble is that Sant canÄôt bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does even among people who are voting Labour
He lost our trust a long time ago and heÄôs not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc talbidla flinging excrement at the fan
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred SantÄôs victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far So I am going to point it out here Marlene Pullicino JeffreyÄôs estranged wife is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes They have lived apart for years and both have formed other relationships since but they have a daughter together
I canÄôt imagine that the daughter a university student is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother I canÄôt imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughterÄôs father the man to whom she was married for some years is being hunted down by her partyÄôs giant machine in this ghastly manner She may not like her estranged husband much any more but surely she has some compassion for her daughter
This must mean one of four things 1 Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughterÄôs sake and he ignored her because he has no compassion 2 Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story and if she didnÄôt she should make this clear at once 3 Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didnÄôt care because she puts political ambition before her daughterÄôs wellbeing or 4 Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ÄòammunitionÄô hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughterÄôs father which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was
Whichever way you look at it itÄôs hideous I repeat heÄôs far from being an honourable man A man like this cannot possibly command respect
Floods of tears
Alfred SantÄôs ugly catandmouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando even though it was quite obvious that he intended to while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours ending up in Gozo Then when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind they thought of a cunning plan SantÄôs aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference and the short notice Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids
So why has it boomeranged Simple Äì people arenÄôt blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions he isnÄôt he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about He wouldnÄôt have run like a rat from press conference to press conference his ÄòvictimÄô hot on his tail and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it People are asking Äì why didnÄôt he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino OrlandoÄôs face The answer is a straightforward one Alfred Sant like all bullies is a coward and when somebody is twisting the truth about you they find it very difficult if not impossible to do it with you standing right there listening
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect it has done precisely the opposite All heÄôs shown us is that heÄôs not much of a man far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities
Ironically his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist PartyÄôs list has rebounded badly If youÄôre going to pick on somebody choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando Even Labour people do So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly nasty unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroomÄôs popular charmer Äì not a good move When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred SantÄôs spite it would have been a public relations masterstroke had it been planned but it was genuine Real tears real anger and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign He enrages us because he doesnÄôt behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes items that have already been carried out by this government and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction
And yet at its mass meeting today the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Äì all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit The Labour Party seems to have invested more time money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme
That should tell you where the partyÄôs priorities lie
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least thatÄôs what Alfred Sant claims HeÄôs said it several times over the last few days and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology Sant behaved like the gentleman he isnÄôt and rushed off to Gozo where after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology then GonziPN is not going to get one Then he made the adult equivalent of a childÄôs playground nehnehneh gesture
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ÄòjitnejkuÄô and Äòjiehduh fÄôghajnhomÄô in his political debates and speeches And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesnÄôt want young people who live in Gozo to be ÄòinkazzatiÄô Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred SantÄôs speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc talbidla gatherings And so it was yesterday morning when he pulled another health document from his tophat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience First he read it out in English then he translated it into Maltese then he put it into the simplest vernacular like a fuddyduddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong
If he is as smart and DBAed as he makes himself out to be then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what nonBritish nonMaltese people pay when they use our state health services ThatÄôs why they are miscellaneous and not regular
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli werenÄôt exactly going to challenge him about it either
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem ItÄôs tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your paycheque without proper overtime payments is signed by a political party But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack lose their temper and snap out something unwise
So far Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
ADÄôs exponents have taken to calling MaltaÄôs democratically elected governments a system of Äòsingleparty dictatorshipÄô or Äòsingleparty ruleÄô This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums donÄôt count and that only general elections do Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate Presumably in their book tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a Äòsingleparty dictatorshipÄô will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy
I canÄôt help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement repeating jargon and stock phrases single party rule single party dictatorship tyranny of the oligarchy coalition works ItÄôs just too tedious Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping
And like all cults they just wonÄôt let up and leave the rest of us alone I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat
HeÄôs been inside him
No this is not my crass choice of expression ItÄôs that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit he who operated on the party leader Interviewed on one of those Super One sofashows he told his host who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant no surprises expected ÄúJien luniku bniedem fiddinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwaÄ¶hahahahahahaÄ¶u nghidilkom jien mÄôhemmx hdura hemm gewÄù Oh dear too much information
Taken from one of the Internet posts
ÄúAlternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP This frantic effort to assume the powerbroker role in the forthcoming general election is to say the least nauseating It amply shows that indeed AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLPÄù
ÄúThe PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright ADÄôs shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II culminating in the Prodi government of which ADÄôs Arnold Cassola formed part until it was brought down due to its fractious compositionÄù
ÄúAD should be turned down not only by the big parties but also by the discerning electorate who have at heart the true wellbeing of MaltaÄù
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation IÄôm puzzled when I hear this They are usually people who almost certainly have an Olevel in maths though of course nothing in civic education because it wasnÄôt and probably still isnÄôt a taught subject at school The reasoning goes something like this a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce and so I will vote AD
Then I butt in How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal or is it just a symbolic protest vote The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance Oh so it is a strategic vote then You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce I prod a little harder How do you think AD will be able to do this with a single seat in parliament Remember that AD had a seat for three years between 1989 and 1992 ÄúI didnÄôt know thatÄù and precisely nothing happened Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour
But AD wonÄôt just have a seat IÄôm told It will be in government Really How does that happen with one seat It will form a coalition Who with The Nationalist Party of course As if theyÄôd form a coalition with Labour I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasnÄôt ruled out coalition with Labour Meanwhile Labour hasnÄôt said what it will or wonÄôt do because Alfred Sant doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
So letÄôs imagine just for the sake of argument because in this election as in all others either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one The seat ratio in other words is 321 Meanwhile the Nationalist Party sitting on the Opposition benches has 32 seats To push any of its legislation through Labour is going to need ADÄôs vote remember this is a fantasy because it canÄôt actually happen in reality This means that AD can derail LabourÄôs legislation You may think that this is good or bad Äì whatever It doesnÄôt matter for the purpose of this argument What does matter is this simple fact you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats but with one seat you canÄôt The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it As any seasoned negotiator knows to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered it must have considerable leverage The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce In other words itÄôs not going to happen And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone without AD playing doginthemanger And so for that matter can the Nationalist Party

A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona the tall large and policemanshaped photographer of The Malta Independent The strapline reads ÄòGonziPN secret police spy on AN supportersÄô

Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of SantÄôs lastbutone trip to Gozo It was worth it just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them sensible fellow What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper By an extraordinary coincidence I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island The very same businessmen looked bright and energised and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration I think that says it all
This isnÄôt me speaking
ItÄôs a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal I thought it was rather good
ÄùYes we do want change We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats Äì two general elections and a referendum Äì and the record shortest government since Independence Unfortunately Dr Sant with his 16 years of leadership almost 30 years in the MLP including his presidency of the party in the dark mid1980s his democratic gaffes like Äòpartnership rebahÄô his political blunders like ÄòSvizzera filMediterrananÄô the electoral promises he failed to keep and above all his administrative mistakes is not in a position to offer anything new still less so a New Beginning He was just never fit for the jobÄù
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning as did the Prime MinisterÄôs More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past he says heÄôll leave it to the historians to decide because as far as heÄôs concerned itÄôs all water under the bridge and he has no regrets And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour governmentÄôs corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid1980s And those were the days when you couldnÄôt report it to the Commissioner of Police because not only was he a ÄòparaventuÄô for corruption in the real sense of the word but his men were not to be trusted LetÄôs say that this is some kind of act of redemption on SantÄôs part Äì protesting too much now because he didnÄôt protest enough or at all then
He doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions Maybe thatÄôs why throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question What do you plan to do if you become prime minister
Now we know why he doesnÄôt tell us his plans He doesnÄôt deal in hypotheses So he doesnÄôt answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical and he doesnÄôt answer questions about the past because itÄôs all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge That doesnÄôt leave much for an interviewer to be going on with which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewerÄôs least favourite subject Äì except for the lovely Simone Cini that is because she isnÄôt exactly out to give him a good grilling
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister For those who donÄôt know him this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould He had Äì still has but he is retired now Äì the inscrutability of a dowager duchessÄôs butler and the allperceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister A civil servant since colonial times he did everything with perfect correctness You can imagine just how well he got along with Äòbazwar Äòl hawn bazwar Äòl hemmÄô Sant LetÄôs just say that it wasnÄôt love at first sight or at second sight either
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister Interestingly Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasnÄôt water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service
A few days later Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and unshackled by the Estacode spilt the beans on Sant in an article called Äì donÄôt you just love it Äì ÄúNothing but untruthsÄù I couldnÄôt have put it better myself So I read on until I came to the last paragraph which IÄôll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up The Times 29 February
ÄúI have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates I shall not elaborate further in that regard His selfdeclared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir Äòl hemm u ftit tbazwir Äòl hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen and to all others It is selfevident that with Dr Sant at the helm Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster In contrast Lawrence GonziÄôs outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime ministerÄù
If Sant owned a television set he famously does not he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes Minister and learn some useful lessons the most useful of which is this never cross Sir Humphrey
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30yearold Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille
ÄòAlfred Sant Äì IlVizjoni ghallBidlaÄô is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc talbidla at waiting hordes of admirers I canÄôt imagine who might buy it except people like me who want a good giggle because itÄôs the most embarrassing sort of hagiography Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung Äì though of course Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words translated from the Maltese ÄúAfter he finished his studies in Paris he went to America to study at the best university Harvard where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studiedÄù The English translation is deliberately clumsy to reproduce the full effect of the original
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then
No wonder he makes such a hash of things because as far as I can discern from this hagiography he never took a refresher course
Ah but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto
ÄúAlfred Sant IlVizjoni GhallBidla is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Written by novelist Frans Sammut it is an intimate portrait of a highbrow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa That won the Broadcasting AuthorityÄôs TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr SammutÄôs critical eye The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained perhaps for the first time Dr SantÄôs philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writerpolitician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed detailsÄù
Those of you who have been led up the gardenpath by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed There is no sex in this book
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign To do this they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures Maybe thatÄôs why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on Äì for if he canÄôt blind us with facts and figures what can he do Oh he can talk about DNA instead or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter whoÄôs just asked him about the Gozo incinerator while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder ÄúMur xommuÄù
On Super One the other day Norman Hamilton the shadow minister of finance the wouldbe prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ÄògrantÄô to firsttime homebuyers Except that itÄôs not a grant of course but a loan Äì because if and when you sell the property you have to pay the government back with interest Astonishingly they didnÄôt mention the word ÄòeurosÄô once even though youÄôd think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money he speaks about liri for all the world as though 1 January hadnÄôt come and gone LabourÄôs electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the partyÄôs state of denial about the euro The bit about subsidised loans to firsttime homebuyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50000 a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007 but which gives us the rather odd figure of Ç¨116500 now When explaining LabourÄôs houseloans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices Sant said ÄúWhoever sets the price at Lm56000 would consider selling at Lm49000 or Lm50000 to qualify under the schemeÄù
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good He isnÄôt trying very hard to embrace the euro now is he
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read ÄòLabour will respect European CourtÄôs rulingÄô The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists We expect too little from Labour and thatÄôs precisely what we get
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies the Lion of Change and Charlie ÄòDNAÄô Mangion tell us that they will get the best out of Europe Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt of dire trepidation Maybe itÄôs because IÄôm a shallow person but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache I canÄôt imagine the Lion of Change fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church his lucky santa talMadonna safely in his pocket heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats
Picture the same delegation that is now making pitstop tours of villages on the kowc talbidla piling onto the flight to Brussels faces grimly and determinedly set ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant Alla Hares Jitilghu lPagi Vella and the Lion of Change Embarrassing doesnÄôt even begin to describe it
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997 when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET He had already been in power for a year and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semihysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with MaltaÄôs taxation problem frozen application and all they still had to deal with the EU The minute he found out I was Maltese and that I didnÄôt like the government he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax It was spot on and there I was torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits one of whom read out a longwinded speech at the negotiatingtable
Bugeyed on strong espressos my coffeebar acquaintance demanded of me ÄúWhy is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient systemÄù I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it and a cunning plan to replace it instead And out came the rejoinder ÄúWhy did your people choose such a manÄù
I didnÄôt know the answer to that one I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and that in 1987 with all that killing corruption violence and fear the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell who wears a lapelbutton claiming that Enoch Powell was right is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ÄònitnejkuÄô and Äòjiehduh fÄôghajnhomÄô in his speeches another party leader in a wig the most recent model displaying goldengrey streaks and highlights yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest Emy of the Alpha Party and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety
ÄúIÄôm contesting so that when weÄôve been completely invaded by immigrants this cowardly people even though sincere will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend themÄù he explained The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at At least 1600 people voted for him in the MEP elections
Next to this lot of rival party leaders Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane I think IÄôll vote for him
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one whether we want to or not What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me Like the members of a cult AD are working at persuading the gullible through the use of jargon and emotive ideals that 1 a coalition government is possible and 2 it is desirable rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country AD jumps out of the woodwork and says but what about Germany Yes what indeed Germany is now in a huge mess Äì as the New Left of postGDR communists come to the fore traditional coalitions are ruled out leaving a swamp of uncertainty
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92 of the vote There is simply no scope for coalition here even if those parties wanted it and Alfred Sant as we know doesnÄôt discuss hypothetical questions Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party This means that Nationalist seats in the partyÄôs traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003 when there was a strong vote for Europe let alone now with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats In this case a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament If a third party gets a seat it doesnÄôt Things stay as they are This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into SantÄôs lap even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party and we will have a rerun of 1981
Even if AD doesnÄôt gain a seat it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own but as a sort of Junior PN Äì which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government So I ask if these people donÄôt mind a Labour government why donÄôt they just vote for it in the first place And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister because they prefer him to Sant why arenÄôt they deploying common sense and voting for his party instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those proEU Labour supporters who in 2003 voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope It just doesnÄôt make sense
You canÄôt take AD seriously in any case not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this ÄúFrom where I stand having Dr Sant as prime minister in a singleparty government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another singleparty governmentÄù Äì Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him
Labour United
When the members of Alfred SantÄôs shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leaderÄôs myriad qualities and his robust strength what they convince us of and probably also Sant himself is not their loyalty but their fear Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them
Throughout this election campaign Sant has gone about as part of a huddle not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities he is halfburied in wouldbe ministers all pressing into the camera shot They look absolutely ridiculous as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone Äì just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him Each time Sant was upset to see him and fell back on some secondary subject Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry he launched into a tirade against him When a reporter asked him on camera why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements he just smirked
Bullies are cowards really but we learned that at school If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando he would have no problem staring him down while saying it It is only when we lie about people or lie to them that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening Sant doesnÄôt want his victims shouting ÄòLiarÄô from the back of the crowd so he avoids them ÄúOnly journalists are invited to my press conferencesÄù he said Oh really I didnÄôt know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra or to approach the gates of the MEPA
Sant does the same with the prime minister This morning seemingly halfcut on his podium in Gozo though it was so early in the day he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldnÄôt give a single one He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddytrain Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar but he canÄôt say it to his face HeÄôs much too lilylivered and he knows it isnÄôt true The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isnÄôt true Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language the unspoken messages that come through delivery posture and behaviour And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when theyÄôre being liberal with the truth and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders IÄôd like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then I would think that he doesnÄôt have what it takes The trouble is that Sant canÄôt bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does even among people who are voting Labour
He lost our trust a long time ago and heÄôs not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc talbidla flinging excrement at the fan
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred SantÄôs victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far So I am going to point it out here Marlene Pullicino JeffreyÄôs estranged wife is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes They have lived apart for years and both have formed other relationships since but they have a daughter together
I canÄôt imagine that the daughter a university student is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother I canÄôt imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughterÄôs father the man to whom she was married for some years is being hunted down by her partyÄôs giant machine in this ghastly manner She may not like her estranged husband much any more but surely she has some compassion for her daughter
This must mean one of four things 1 Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughterÄôs sake and he ignored her because he has no compassion 2 Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story and if she didnÄôt she should make this clear at once 3 Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didnÄôt care because she puts political ambition before her daughterÄôs wellbeing or 4 Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ÄòammunitionÄô hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughterÄôs father which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was
Whichever way you look at it itÄôs hideous I repeat heÄôs far from being an honourable man A man like this cannot possibly command respect
Floods of tears
Alfred SantÄôs ugly catandmouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando even though it was quite obvious that he intended to while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours ending up in Gozo Then when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind they thought of a cunning plan SantÄôs aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference and the short notice Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids
So why has it boomeranged Simple Äì people arenÄôt blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions he isnÄôt he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about He wouldnÄôt have run like a rat from press conference to press conference his ÄòvictimÄô hot on his tail and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it People are asking Äì why didnÄôt he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino OrlandoÄôs face The answer is a straightforward one Alfred Sant like all bullies is a coward and when somebody is twisting the truth about you they find it very difficult if not impossible to do it with you standing right there listening
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect it has done precisely the opposite All heÄôs shown us is that heÄôs not much of a man far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities
Ironically his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist PartyÄôs list has rebounded badly If youÄôre going to pick on somebody choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando Even Labour people do So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly nasty unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroomÄôs popular charmer Äì not a good move When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred SantÄôs spite it would have been a public relations masterstroke had it been planned but it was genuine Real tears real anger and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign He enrages us because he doesnÄôt behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes items that have already been carried out by this government and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction
And yet at its mass meeting today the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Äì all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit The Labour Party seems to have invested more time money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme
That should tell you where the partyÄôs priorities lie
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least thatÄôs what Alfred Sant claims HeÄôs said it several times over the last few days and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology Sant behaved like the gentleman he isnÄôt and rushed off to Gozo where after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology then GonziPN is not going to get one Then he made the adult equivalent of a childÄôs playground nehnehneh gesture
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ÄòjitnejkuÄô and Äòjiehduh fÄôghajnhomÄô in his political debates and speeches And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesnÄôt want young people who live in Gozo to be ÄòinkazzatiÄô Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred SantÄôs speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc talbidla gatherings And so it was yesterday morning when he pulled another health document from his tophat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience First he read it out in English then he translated it into Maltese then he put it into the simplest vernacular like a fuddyduddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong
If he is as smart and DBAed as he makes himself out to be then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what nonBritish nonMaltese people pay when they use our state health services ThatÄôs why they are miscellaneous and not regular
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli werenÄôt exactly going to challenge him about it either
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem ItÄôs tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your paycheque without proper overtime payments is signed by a political party But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack lose their temper and snap out something unwise
So far Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
ADÄôs exponents have taken to calling MaltaÄôs democratically elected governments a system of Äòsingleparty dictatorshipÄô or Äòsingleparty ruleÄô This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums donÄôt count and that only general elections do Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate Presumably in their book tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a Äòsingleparty dictatorshipÄô will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy
I canÄôt help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement repeating jargon and stock phrases single party rule single party dictatorship tyranny of the oligarchy coalition works ItÄôs just too tedious Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping
And like all cults they just wonÄôt let up and leave the rest of us alone I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat
HeÄôs been inside him
No this is not my crass choice of expression ItÄôs that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit he who operated on the party leader Interviewed on one of those Super One sofashows he told his host who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant no surprises expected ÄúJien luniku bniedem fiddinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwaÄ¶hahahahahahaÄ¶u nghidilkom jien mÄôhemmx hdura hemm gewÄù Oh dear too much information
Taken from one of the Internet posts
ÄúAlternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP This frantic effort to assume the powerbroker role in the forthcoming general election is to say the least nauseating It amply shows that indeed AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLPÄù
ÄúThe PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright ADÄôs shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II culminating in the Prodi government of which ADÄôs Arnold Cassola formed part until it was brought down due to its fractious compositionÄù
ÄúAD should be turned down not only by the big parties but also by the discerning electorate who have at heart the true wellbeing of MaltaÄù
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation IÄôm puzzled when I hear this They are usually people who almost certainly have an Olevel in maths though of course nothing in civic education because it wasnÄôt and probably still isnÄôt a taught subject at school The reasoning goes something like this a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce and so I will vote AD
Then I butt in How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal or is it just a symbolic protest vote The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance Oh so it is a strategic vote then You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce I prod a little harder How do you think AD will be able to do this with a single seat in parliament Remember that AD had a seat for three years between 1989 and 1992 ÄúI didnÄôt know thatÄù and precisely nothing happened Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour
But AD wonÄôt just have a seat IÄôm told It will be in government Really How does that happen with one seat It will form a coalition Who with The Nationalist Party of course As if theyÄôd form a coalition with Labour I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasnÄôt ruled out coalition with Labour Meanwhile Labour hasnÄôt said what it will or wonÄôt do because Alfred Sant doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
So letÄôs imagine just for the sake of argument because in this election as in all others either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one The seat ratio in other words is 321 Meanwhile the Nationalist Party sitting on the Opposition benches has 32 seats To push any of its legislation through Labour is going to need ADÄôs vote remember this is a fantasy because it canÄôt actually happen in reality This means that AD can derail LabourÄôs legislation You may think that this is good or bad Äì whatever It doesnÄôt matter for the purpose of this argument What does matter is this simple fact you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats but with one seat you canÄôt The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it As any seasoned negotiator knows to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered it must have considerable leverage The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce In other words itÄôs not going to happen And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone without AD playing doginthemanger And so for that matter can the Nationalist Party
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona the tall large and policemanshaped photographer of The Malta Independent The strapline reads ÄòGonziPN secret police spy on AN supportersÄô
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night ÄúWho is this manÄù the video commentary asked ÄúAnd why is he spying on us He appears at every AN meeting talks to nobody takes his photograph and leaves And God knows where those photographs end upÄù
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent Maybe AN needs a media officer
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of SantÄôs lastbutone trip to Gozo It was worth it just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them sensible fellow What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper By an extraordinary coincidence I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island The very same businessmen looked bright and energised and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration I think that says it all
This isnÄôt me speaking
ItÄôs a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal I thought it was rather good
ÄùYes we do want change We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats Äì two general elections and a referendum Äì and the record shortest government since Independence Unfortunately Dr Sant with his 16 years of leadership almost 30 years in the MLP including his presidency of the party in the dark mid1980s his democratic gaffes like Äòpartnership rebahÄô his political blunders like ÄòSvizzera filMediterrananÄô the electoral promises he failed to keep and above all his administrative mistakes is not in a position to offer anything new still less so a New Beginning He was just never fit for the jobÄù
  

  
This morning the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonightÄôs political programme Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist PartyÄôs media He turned white demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there and asked the BA representatives to have him removed The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate he couldnÄôt go on the show unless scheduled to do so as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground and with the cameras rolling challenged Sant to have the guts not the best choice of phrase given the nature of his recent surgery to say what he had to say to his face Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him When this didnÄôt happen Äì a shame because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strongarmed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on Äì Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage
What a coward
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One where he feels safe on home ground and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman he sat grim and wheyfaced behind a desk and addressed the nation giving his reasons why he sulked It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it and he wouldnÄôt because he still has no regrets
The BA recording was cancelled This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight Äì unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle wait for the next NET news bulletin or watch BondiPlus tonight Remember that if SantÄôs BA programme remains unrecorded BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 830pm news on TVM
Ja pufta
LabourÄôs deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks hunting and santi talMadonna filbut HeÄôs the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania so you can just imagine what weÄôre talking about here
Now to compound his hip cool and politically correct New Labour image the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying ÄòKemm hu pufta u LouÄô ThatÄôs another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight And of course he had to go and say it to somebody whoÄôs bisexual
Labour United Äì theyÄôre a winning team
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who havenÄôt read Jenny Pullicino OrlandoÄôs comment on this blog please do so immediately IÄôve reproduced it beneath It puts SantÄôs empty words about Äòfamily valuesÄô letÄôs face it Äì he didnÄôt have any family values himself did he into their proper perspective Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino The marriage broke down some years ago but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children
As Jenny points out here Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children More to the point he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate MarleneÄôs student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father whom she loves and supports
He is not only a coward but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function To him families are just a concept Äì something you read about in books as a theory
What a despicable man And a pathetic coward
Dearest Daphne
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation
I am now at home unable to attend University in peace because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions To add insult to injury Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt no doubt I call for these people to leave me alone let me be Let us be I was enraged when they used your son for political gain I was also targeted by Super One on the same day they filmed me for a substantial amount of time so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly
Obviously using clips of me showing public disgust at SantÄôs behaviour could not be used on Super One especially once I put glasses on which made me look all the more like my mother a candidate for MLP Hats off to your son for telling them off You should honestly be proud of him The unprecedented lows that they have reached using children for political gain and infantile propaganda has only attracted disgust
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right I have defended my right to an opinion which she has gracefully accepted This is in no way an attack on my motherÄôs credibility as a politician I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do No I was not informed by my mother about the situation because she seems to not have known anything about it No Alfred Sant did not inform my mother He kept it within an inner circle ignoring the fact that his candidateÄôs exhusband was going to be under fire and her daughter a firsttime voter would along with her father suffer considerably for no apparent reason
You are not a man of honour DrSant Nor are you a Hero Nor are you capable of running a country The ÄòhamalliÄô at University refused to stand by your side and I was one of them Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined Non je ne regrette rien Well Done
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is I am more proud of him than I ever was
Thanks again Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning as did the Prime MinisterÄôs More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past he says heÄôll leave it to the historians to decide because as far as heÄôs concerned itÄôs all water under the bridge and he has no regrets And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour governmentÄôs corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid1980s And those were the days when you couldnÄôt report it to the Commissioner of Police because not only was he a ÄòparaventuÄô for corruption in the real sense of the word but his men were not to be trusted LetÄôs say that this is some kind of act of redemption on SantÄôs part Äì protesting too much now because he didnÄôt protest enough or at all then
He doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions Maybe thatÄôs why throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question What do you plan to do if you become prime minister
Now we know why he doesnÄôt tell us his plans He doesnÄôt deal in hypotheses So he doesnÄôt answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical and he doesnÄôt answer questions about the past because itÄôs all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge That doesnÄôt leave much for an interviewer to be going on with which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewerÄôs least favourite subject Äì except for the lovely Simone Cini that is because she isnÄôt exactly out to give him a good grilling
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister For those who donÄôt know him this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould He had Äì still has but he is retired now Äì the inscrutability of a dowager duchessÄôs butler and the allperceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister A civil servant since colonial times he did everything with perfect correctness You can imagine just how well he got along with Äòbazwar Äòl hawn bazwar Äòl hemmÄô Sant LetÄôs just say that it wasnÄôt love at first sight or at second sight either
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister Interestingly Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasnÄôt water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service
A few days later Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and unshackled by the Estacode spilt the beans on Sant in an article called Äì donÄôt you just love it Äì ÄúNothing but untruthsÄù I couldnÄôt have put it better myself So I read on until I came to the last paragraph which IÄôll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up The Times 29 February
ÄúI have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates I shall not elaborate further in that regard His selfdeclared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir Äòl hemm u ftit tbazwir Äòl hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen and to all others It is selfevident that with Dr Sant at the helm Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster In contrast Lawrence GonziÄôs outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime ministerÄù
If Sant owned a television set he famously does not he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes Minister and learn some useful lessons the most useful of which is this never cross Sir Humphrey
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30yearold Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille
ÄòAlfred Sant Äì IlVizjoni ghallBidlaÄô is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc talbidla at waiting hordes of admirers I canÄôt imagine who might buy it except people like me who want a good giggle because itÄôs the most embarrassing sort of hagiography Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung Äì though of course Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words translated from the Maltese ÄúAfter he finished his studies in Paris he went to America to study at the best university Harvard where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studiedÄù The English translation is deliberately clumsy to reproduce the full effect of the original
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then
No wonder he makes such a hash of things because as far as I can discern from this hagiography he never took a refresher course
Ah but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto
ÄúAlfred Sant IlVizjoni GhallBidla is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Written by novelist Frans Sammut it is an intimate portrait of a highbrow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa That won the Broadcasting AuthorityÄôs TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr SammutÄôs critical eye The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained perhaps for the first time Dr SantÄôs philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writerpolitician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed detailsÄù
Those of you who have been led up the gardenpath by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed There is no sex in this book
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign To do this they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures Maybe thatÄôs why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on Äì for if he canÄôt blind us with facts and figures what can he do Oh he can talk about DNA instead or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter whoÄôs just asked him about the Gozo incinerator while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder ÄúMur xommuÄù
On Super One the other day Norman Hamilton the shadow minister of finance the wouldbe prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ÄògrantÄô to firsttime homebuyers Except that itÄôs not a grant of course but a loan Äì because if and when you sell the property you have to pay the government back with interest Astonishingly they didnÄôt mention the word ÄòeurosÄô once even though youÄôd think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money he speaks about liri for all the world as though 1 January hadnÄôt come and gone LabourÄôs electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the partyÄôs state of denial about the euro The bit about subsidised loans to firsttime homebuyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50000 a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007 but which gives us the rather odd figure of Ç¨116500 now When explaining LabourÄôs houseloans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices Sant said ÄúWhoever sets the price at Lm56000 would consider selling at Lm49000 or Lm50000 to qualify under the schemeÄù
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good He isnÄôt trying very hard to embrace the euro now is he
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read ÄòLabour will respect European CourtÄôs rulingÄô The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists We expect too little from Labour and thatÄôs precisely what we get
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies the Lion of Change and Charlie ÄòDNAÄô Mangion tell us that they will get the best out of Europe Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt of dire trepidation Maybe itÄôs because IÄôm a shallow person but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache I canÄôt imagine the Lion of Change fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church his lucky santa talMadonna safely in his pocket heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats
Picture the same delegation that is now making pitstop tours of villages on the kowc talbidla piling onto the flight to Brussels faces grimly and determinedly set ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant Alla Hares Jitilghu lPagi Vella and the Lion of Change Embarrassing doesnÄôt even begin to describe it
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997 when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET He had already been in power for a year and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semihysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with MaltaÄôs taxation problem frozen application and all they still had to deal with the EU The minute he found out I was Maltese and that I didnÄôt like the government he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax It was spot on and there I was torn between the desire to be loyal to my country and the far more pressing need to honk out loud with laughter at his description of a delegation of misfits one of whom read out a longwinded speech at the negotiatingtable
Bugeyed on strong espressos my coffeebar acquaintance demanded of me ÄúWhy is your prime minister insisting on creating a tax to replace VAT when VAT is used because it is the most efficient systemÄù I explained that it was because he had an electoral commitment to remove it and a cunning plan to replace it instead And out came the rejoinder ÄúWhy did your people choose such a manÄù
I didnÄôt know the answer to that one I could hardly say that my people also chose Dom Mintoff and Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici and that in 1987 with all that killing corruption violence and fear the Nationalist Party won the general election by the slimmest of majorities
Enoch Lowell
Norman Lowell who wears a lapelbutton claiming that Enoch Powell was right is adding to the carnivalesque atmosphere of this general election So we have one party leader with a penchant for wearing yellow fleeces and pink shirts while shouting ÄònitnejkuÄô and Äòjiehduh fÄôghajnhomÄô in his speeches another party leader in a wig the most recent model displaying goldengrey streaks and highlights yet another who compares himself to a Burmese dissident under house arrest Emy of the Alpha Party and now here comes Norman to add to the gaiety
ÄúIÄôm contesting so that when weÄôve been completely invaded by immigrants this cowardly people even though sincere will not have an excuse that there was nobody to defend themÄù he explained The awful Norman is not to be sniffed at At least 1600 people voted for him in the MEP elections
Next to this lot of rival party leaders Lawrence Gonzi looks reassuringly sane I think IÄôll vote for him
They continue to bore on about coalitions
The Internet forums and blogs are rife with people demanding a coalition government and telling the rest of us what to do to get one whether we want to or not What makes these people imagine that their agenda is a common one is quite beyond me Like the members of a cult AD are working at persuading the gullible through the use of jargon and emotive ideals that 1 a coalition government is possible and 2 it is desirable rather than the kind of necessary evil that countries without strong parties must cope with
Whenever I and others mention Italy as an example of why coalition governments are disastrous for the country AD jumps out of the woodwork and says but what about Germany Yes what indeed Germany is now in a huge mess Äì as the New Left of postGDR communists come to the fore traditional coalitions are ruled out leaving a swamp of uncertainty
Coalitions make for extremely weak governments and attempting to forge a coalition is a pointless exercise in a country like Malta where there are two extremely strong political parties which between them command around 92 of the vote There is simply no scope for coalition here even if those parties wanted it and Alfred Sant as we know doesnÄôt discuss hypothetical questions Either one party or the other is going to get a relative or absolute majority
The way the boundaries have been drawn up in the last reform favours the Labour Party This means that Nationalist seats in the partyÄôs traditional strongholds would have been at risk with these new boundaries even in 2003 when there was a strong vote for Europe let alone now with AD hammering away at the Nationalist vote and others still unable to make the decision between Gonzi and Sant There is a real possibility that the Nationalist Party will get a majority of first preference votes but a minority of seats In this case a correcting mechanism comes into play which adjusts the number of seats in line with the first preference votes This correcting mechanism only applies if there are two parties in parliament If a third party gets a seat it doesnÄôt Things stay as they are This means that a seat for AD throws the premiership into SantÄôs lap even if his party has fewer first preference votes than the Nationalist Party and we will have a rerun of 1981
Even if AD doesnÄôt gain a seat it will still have eaten away at the traditionally Nationalist electorate for all published surveys show that most of those who are planning to vote AD previously voted Nationalist The reality is that they see AD not as a completely separate and different political party with an identity of its own but as a sort of Junior PN Äì which is why they take it for granted that AD will hunker up with the PN in a coalition while the PN sensibly wants nothing to do with them
The result of a strong AD vote but no AD seat is pretty much the same the premiership for Alfred Sant and the Labour Party in government So I ask if these people donÄôt mind a Labour government why donÄôt they just vote for it in the first place And if they want Gonzi to carry on as prime minister because they prefer him to Sant why arenÄôt they deploying common sense and voting for his party instead of voting for somebody else and keeping their fingers crossed
This kind of behaviour reminds me of those proEU Labour supporters who in 2003 voted Yes in the referendum and then voted Labour in the general election and hoped against hope It just doesnÄôt make sense
You canÄôt take AD seriously in any case not when its increasingly delusional leader says things like this ÄúFrom where I stand having Dr Sant as prime minister in a singleparty government is no more scary a prospect than having Dr Gonzi as prime minister of another singleparty governmentÄù Äì Harry Vassallo
Maybe we should all explain to Harry just how scary we are beginning to find him
Labour United
When the members of Alfred SantÄôs shadow cabinet take to the stage to shout about their leaderÄôs myriad qualities and his robust strength what they convince us of and probably also Sant himself is not their loyalty but their fear Harshly controlling leaders produce this reaction in those around them
Throughout this election campaign Sant has gone about as part of a huddle not so much a football team called Labour United as an unappetising rugby scrum Every time we see him in front of the television cameras at one of his press calls or photo opportunities he is halfburied in wouldbe ministers all pressing into the camera shot They look absolutely ridiculous as though they are propping Sant up because he is too weak and cowardly to face the press alone Äì just as he was too weak and cowardly to lie about Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando to his face
Pullicino Orlando had spent the previous 36 hours chasing him from one press conference to another having received word from a Labour mole that Sant planned great revelations about him Each time Sant was upset to see him and fell back on some secondary subject Giving him the slip after a media show in Gozo Sant summoned the press to Mistra with 45 minutes notice Safe in the knowledge that Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the Gozo ferry he launched into a tirade against him When a reporter asked him on camera why he had made these hurried and impromptu arrangements he just smirked
Bullies are cowards really but we learned that at school If Alfred Sant were telling the truth about Pullicino Orlando he would have no problem staring him down while saying it It is only when we lie about people or lie to them that we find it hard to look them in the eye or stand there and speak untruths about them while they are watching and listening Sant doesnÄôt want his victims shouting ÄòLiarÄô from the back of the crowd so he avoids them ÄúOnly journalists are invited to my press conferencesÄù he said Oh really I didnÄôt know you need permission from the Labour Party to stand about in a field at Mistra or to approach the gates of the MEPA
Sant does the same with the prime minister This morning seemingly halfcut on his podium in Gozo though it was so early in the day he told his admirers that Gonzi could ask for all the apologies in the world and he wouldnÄôt give a single one He said this with the facial expression of a kid refusing his brother a turn on the Noddytrain Sant repeats and repeats that Lawrence Gonzi is a corrupt liar but he canÄôt say it to his face HeÄôs much too lilylivered and he knows it isnÄôt true The frustrating thing for Sant is that even his supporters know it isnÄôt true Even the simplest of people can instinctively pick up the signals of body language the unspoken messages that come through delivery posture and behaviour And most of us know by now that people unwittingly touch their nose when theyÄôre being liberal with the truth and Sant did it more than once when being interviewed by Herman Grech on video for The Sunday Times portal
The last Broadcasting Authority debate of the campaign is usually a dead heat between the two party leaders IÄôd like to hear Sant call Gonzi a corrupt liar then I would think that he doesnÄôt have what it takes The trouble is that Sant canÄôt bear to know how Gonzi scores higher on the likeability and trustworthiness stakes than he does even among people who are voting Labour
He lost our trust a long time ago and heÄôs not going to win it back by running round the islands in his kowc talbidla flinging excrement at the fan
  

  
The ugliest part of Alfred SantÄôs victimisation of the popular Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has been left unsaid so far So I am going to point it out here Marlene Pullicino JeffreyÄôs estranged wife is one of the Labour candidates on which the party is staking its hopes They have lived apart for years and both have formed other relationships since but they have a daughter together
I canÄôt imagine that the daughter a university student is delighted to see her father being persecuted and made miserable by the political party which has embraced her mother I canÄôt imagine that Marlene Pullicino approves of the manner in which her daughterÄôs father the man to whom she was married for some years is being hunted down by her partyÄôs giant machine in this ghastly manner She may not like her estranged husband much any more but surely she has some compassion for her daughter
This must mean one of four things 1 Marlene Pullicino asked Alfred Sant not to do it for her daughterÄôs sake and he ignored her because he has no compassion 2 Marlene Pullicino was the one who told Alfred Sant the story and if she didnÄôt she should make this clear at once 3 Marlene Pullicino knew what was about to happen and didnÄôt care because she puts political ambition before her daughterÄôs wellbeing or 4 Alfred Sant and his inner circle kept their ÄòammunitionÄô hidden from Marlene Pullicino in case she alerted her daughterÄôs father which makes Alfred Sant even more of a snake than I thought he was
Whichever way you look at it itÄôs hideous I repeat heÄôs far from being an honourable man A man like this cannot possibly command respect
Floods of tears
Alfred SantÄôs ugly catandmouse game with Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has boomeranged First he made himself look completely ridiculous by refusing to say anything about Pullicino Orlando even though it was quite obvious that he intended to while the latter chased him from one press conference to another for 36 hours ending up in Gozo Then when Sant and his entourage got on the Gozo ferry to return to Malta and realised that Pullicino Orlando had been left behind they thought of a cunning plan SantÄôs aides called journalists and summoned them to a press conference at Mistra with just 45 minutes to go They whizzed there and Sant said his bit while Pullicino Orlando was stuck on the next ferry When a television journalist asked him why the hurried nature of the press conference and the short notice Sant smirked like the classroom sneak who has just grassed on the popular kids
So why has it boomeranged Simple Äì people arenÄôt blind to the fact that if Sant were an upstanding man with the courage of his convictions he isnÄôt he would have said what he had to say in front of the person he was saying it about He wouldnÄôt have run like a rat from press conference to press conference his ÄòvictimÄô hot on his tail and then waited until he had given him the slip to come out with it People are asking Äì why didnÄôt he have the guts to say what he had to say in Pullicino OrlandoÄôs face The answer is a straightforward one Alfred Sant like all bullies is a coward and when somebody is twisting the truth about you they find it very difficult if not impossible to do it with you standing right there listening
If Sant hoped that this would win him respect it has done precisely the opposite All heÄôs shown us is that heÄôs not much of a man far from honourable and seriously devoid of leadership qualities
Ironically his attempted hammering of one of the most popular candidates on the Nationalist PartyÄôs list has rebounded badly If youÄôre going to pick on somebody choosing a soft target is not a good idea because it makes you look like a dreadful bully The fact is that people genuinely like Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando Even Labour people do So Alfred Sant just came across as the ugly nasty unpopular kid trying to cause trouble for the classroomÄôs popular charmer Äì not a good move When Pullicino Orlando broke down and sobbed in public this morning while raging against Alfred SantÄôs spite it would have been a public relations masterstroke had it been planned but it was genuine Real tears real anger and a real summing up of how people are now feeling about Alfred Sant in this campaign He enrages us because he doesnÄôt behave like a normal person and he seems to have no emotions whatsoever coming across as being driven by hatred and rage and a determination to fulfil what he sees as his destiny to become prime minister of Malta once more
Books and misprints
Labour had five years to produce an electoral programme and came up with a shoddy piece of work full of mistakes items that have already been carried out by this government and shortcomings that Alfred Sant described to an interviewer as being caused by a computer malfunction
And yet at its mass meeting today the party is selling a new novella from the Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Äì all about the biggest scandals Fred and Jason and their merry men could come up with what purports to be the full whack on Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando and Ninu Zammit The Labour Party seems to have invested more time money and effort in producing this publication than it did in producing its electoral programme
That should tell you where the partyÄôs priorities lie
GonziPN is a corrupt liar
At least thatÄôs what Alfred Sant claims HeÄôs said it several times over the last few days and when Lawrence Gonzi demanded an apology Sant behaved like the gentleman he isnÄôt and rushed off to Gozo where after clearly not having had milkshake for breakfast he told his throng that if GonziPN wants an apology then GonziPN is not going to get one Then he made the adult equivalent of a childÄôs playground nehnehneh gesture
Bad language
First we had Josie Muscat shouting out ÄòjitnejkuÄô and Äòjiehduh fÄôghajnhomÄô in his political debates and speeches And then yesterday morning we had Alfred Sant on his Gozo podium losing control of his tongue and saying that he doesnÄôt want young people who live in Gozo to be ÄòinkazzatiÄô Not the best choice of word for a future prime minister
Miscellaneous fees
Some of the most amusing parts of Alfred SantÄôs speeches are when he tries to explain technical language and corporate concepts to people at his kowc talbidla gatherings And so it was yesterday morning when he pulled another health document from his tophat and tried to explain consolidated funds and miscellaneous fees for hospital services to his unknowing audience First he read it out in English then he translated it into Maltese then he put it into the simplest vernacular like a fuddyduddy professor trying to relate to a child and getting it all wrong
If he is as smart and DBAed as he makes himself out to be then he would have gathered that the miscellaneous fees in question are what nonBritish nonMaltese people pay when they use our state health services ThatÄôs why they are miscellaneous and not regular
But Sant was counting on the fact that none of his people would know this and that Charlon Gouder and Miriam Dalli werenÄôt exactly going to challenge him about it either
Charlon Gouder
Now this is a man with a problem ItÄôs tough enough doing your work as a journalist when your paycheque without proper overtime payments is signed by a political party But sometimes you can find a workable solution within the limits
Charlon Gouder appears not to have found that solution His role throughout this campaign has been that of Labour heckler dispatched to meetings to shout accusations at Nationalist politicians until they crack lose their temper and snap out something unwise
So far Lawrence Gonzi has resisted the temptation to put a rocket under this man treating him with the kind of resilient patience of a calm and steady uncle coping with a temperamental and rebellious nephew And the curious thing is that on Xarabank last Friday even the steadfast Charlon seemed to have ended up charmed by him into a sort of reluctant admiration
Hare Krishna of Maltese politics
ADÄôs exponents have taken to calling MaltaÄôs democratically elected governments a system of Äòsingleparty dictatorshipÄô or Äòsingleparty ruleÄô This is like Alfred Sant declaring that referendums donÄôt count and that only general elections do Both statements ignore or disparage the sovereign will of the electorate Presumably in their book tacking a single AD seat onto the edge of a Äòsingleparty dictatorshipÄô will immediately make it the sine qua non of democracy
I canÄôt help but notice that AD akkaniti are beginning to sound like the brainwashed members of a cult movement repeating jargon and stock phrases single party rule single party dictatorship tyranny of the oligarchy coalition works ItÄôs just too tedious Alternattiva Demokratika have become the Hare Krishna of Maltese politics springing out at you with their chants and mantras about coalitions and dictatorships when all you want to do is get on with your shopping
And like all cults they just wonÄôt let up and leave the rest of us alone I wish I had the time and patience to trawl back through the newspapers over the last couple of years and discover exactly at what point the desire for a mere seat in parliament became the fixation on power and being in government purely on the basis of that mere seat
HeÄôs been inside him
No this is not my crass choice of expression ItÄôs that of the surgeon and Labour candidate Anthony Zammit he who operated on the party leader Interviewed on one of those Super One sofashows he told his host who had asked for his views about Alfred Sant no surprises expected ÄúJien luniku bniedem fiddinja li nista nghid li nafu minn barra u minn gewwaÄ¶hahahahahahaÄ¶u nghidilkom jien mÄôhemmx hdura hemm gewÄù Oh dear too much information
Taken from one of the Internet posts
ÄúAlternattiva Demokratika has declared that it is prepared to form a coalition government with either the PN or the MLP This frantic effort to assume the powerbroker role in the forthcoming general election is to say the least nauseating It amply shows that indeed AD is a soulless party made up of political mavericks whose main aim is to hold to ransom both the PN and the MLPÄù
ÄúThe PN leadership is correct in dismissing outright ADÄôs shameful proposal and it would be appropriate for the MLP leadership to follow suit Malta deserves a stable government so that the full benefits of EU membership are enjoyed by the whole population What AD is proposing would slide Malta into an ungovernable situation similar to what Italy has experienced over the years since the end of World War II culminating in the Prodi government of which ADÄôs Arnold Cassola formed part until it was brought down due to its fractious compositionÄù
ÄúAD should be turned down not only by the big parties but also by the discerning electorate who have at heart the true wellbeing of MaltaÄù
Divorce
Some people are saying that they will vote AD because they want divorce legislation IÄôm puzzled when I hear this They are usually people who almost certainly have an Olevel in maths though of course nothing in civic education because it wasnÄôt and probably still isnÄôt a taught subject at school The reasoning goes something like this a Nationalist government will not legislate for divorce and so I will vote AD
Then I butt in How will voting AD help you to achieve your goal or is it just a symbolic protest vote The suggestion that it is a protest vote is met with annoyance Oh so it is a strategic vote then You are voting AD because you imagine that AD can somehow amend the Marriage Act and bring in divorce I prod a little harder How do you think AD will be able to do this with a single seat in parliament Remember that AD had a seat for three years between 1989 and 1992 ÄúI didnÄôt know thatÄù and precisely nothing happened Then Wenzu Mintoff went back home to Labour
But AD wonÄôt just have a seat IÄôm told It will be in government Really How does that happen with one seat It will form a coalition Who with The Nationalist Party of course As if theyÄôd form a coalition with Labour I explain that the Nationalist Party has ruled out any coalition and that Harry Vassallo hasnÄôt ruled out coalition with Labour Meanwhile Labour hasnÄôt said what it will or wonÄôt do because Alfred Sant doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
So letÄôs imagine just for the sake of argument because in this election as in all others either one of the main parties is going to get a relative or absolute majority and govern alone that we end up with an MLPAD coalition government The MLP has 32 seats and AD has a meagre one The seat ratio in other words is 321 Meanwhile the Nationalist Party sitting on the Opposition benches has 32 seats To push any of its legislation through Labour is going to need ADÄôs vote remember this is a fantasy because it canÄôt actually happen in reality This means that AD can derail LabourÄôs legislation You may think that this is good or bad Äì whatever It doesnÄôt matter for the purpose of this argument What does matter is this simple fact you can bring forward legislation with 32 seats but with one seat you canÄôt The only way that AD with one seat in a coalition government can introduce divorce is by bullying 32 Labour MPs into voting for it As any seasoned negotiator knows to do this when it is so vastly outnumbered it must have considerable leverage The only leverage I can think of here is the threat to derail some legislation that Labour really wants to get through Yet divorce is a very big thing in Malta and so Labour must really want that other legislation strongly enough to trade it for the introduction of divorce In other words itÄôs not going to happen And commonsense should tell you that if Labour can be persuaded into voting for divorce to keep AD happy with its one seat then Labour can also be persuaded to bring in divorce alone without AD playing doginthemanger And so for that matter can the Nationalist Party
The secret police spy on Azzjoni Nazzjonali
A keen activist has uploaded a video on YouTube showing an AN public gathering being photographed by Ben Borg Cardona the tall large and policemanshaped photographer of The Malta Independent The strapline reads ÄòGonziPN secret police spy on AN supportersÄô
Lots of AN supporters are conspiracy theorists who love the dark world of computer games and belong to all these Internet forums where strange people gather at night ÄúWho is this manÄù the video commentary asked ÄúAnd why is he spying on us He appears at every AN meeting talks to nobody takes his photograph and leaves And God knows where those photographs end upÄù
They sometimes end up in The Malta Independent Maybe AN needs a media officer
Alfred Sant meets a pig
I happened to be watching Super One when they showed coverage of SantÄôs lastbutone trip to Gozo It was worth it just for that shot of the Labour delegation giving comments to camera while standing around a giant puddle of bright yellow urine and then saying hello to a large pig which ignored them sensible fellow What struck me most were the downcast faces of the Gozo businessmen summoned to a meeting with their hypothetically future prime minister They looked as though they had been called to meet the Grim Reaper By an extraordinary coincidence I also had the television on when NET showed coverage of a similar meeting Lawrence Gonzi had on our sister island The very same businessmen looked bright and energised and at least one of them spoke with electric admiration I think that says it all
This isnÄôt me speaking
ItÄôs a comment posted beneath a story on The Times Internet portal I thought it was rather good
ÄùYes we do want change We would like Dr Sant to step down from the leadership of his party We would have preferred him to do so after the 2003 election as any democratic leader in a democratic country would have done after three consecutive defeats Äì two general elections and a referendum Äì and the record shortest government since Independence Unfortunately Dr Sant with his 16 years of leadership almost 30 years in the MLP including his presidency of the party in the dark mid1980s his democratic gaffes like Äòpartnership rebahÄô his political blunders like ÄòSvizzera filMediterrananÄô the electoral promises he failed to keep and above all his administrative mistakes is not in a position to offer anything new still less so a New Beginning He was just never fit for the jobÄù
  

  
This morning the Broadcasting Authority was scheduled to record tonightÄôs political programme Alfred Sant fielding questions from journalists
Sant turned up to find that the journalists included Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando armed with a press card and representing the Nationalist PartyÄôs media He turned white demanded to know what Pullicino Orlando was doing there and asked the BA representatives to have him removed The chairman of the BA took legal advice and came back with the ruling that because Pullicino Orlando is a candidate he couldnÄôt go on the show unless scheduled to do so as this would give him unfair exposure to the detriment of other candidates
Pullicino Orlando stood his ground and with the cameras rolling challenged Sant to have the guts not the best choice of phrase given the nature of his recent surgery to say what he had to say to his face Sant continued to insist that Pullicino Orlando be forcibly removed from the premises Then he demanded that the police be called to remove him When this didnÄôt happen Äì a shame because we would have loved to see footage of Pullicino Orlando being strongarmed out of the room by men in uniform while Sant stood gloating on Äì Sant threw a hissy fit and stormed out in a white rage
What a coward
Then he shot to the friendly studios at Super One where he feels safe on home ground and with Jason playing Robin to his Batman he sat grim and wheyfaced behind a desk and addressed the nation giving his reasons why he sulked It brought to mind the spectacle of him doing much the same thing in the aftermath of 2003 general election when he more or less said that the people of Malta had done the wrong thing and they would live to regret it and he wouldnÄôt because he still has no regrets
The BA recording was cancelled This means that no political programme in the BA schedule will be aired tonight Äì unless the Labour heavies manage to use a mixture of threats persuasion and bullying tactics to convince the Broadcasting Authority that the recording should be rescheduled without the presence of a representative of the Nationalist media
Those of you who are dying to see footage of the whole spectacle wait for the next NET news bulletin or watch BondiPlus tonight Remember that if SantÄôs BA programme remains unrecorded BondiPlus will go on air immediately after the 830pm news on TVM
Ja pufta
LabourÄôs deputy leader Michael Falzon adds to his reputation as an antediluvian throwback of fireworks hunting and santi talMadonna filbut HeÄôs the legal adviser to the Association of Fireworks Factories and goes hunting in Romania so you can just imagine what weÄôre talking about here
Now to compound his hip cool and politically correct New Labour image the Lion of Change has been caught on camera turning to Jason Micallef and saying ÄòKemm hu pufta u LouÄô ThatÄôs another clip you can watch on BondiPlus tonight And of course he had to go and say it to somebody whoÄôs bisexual
Labour United Äì theyÄôre a winning team
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
Those who havenÄôt read Jenny Pullicino OrlandoÄôs comment on this blog please do so immediately IÄôve reproduced it beneath It puts SantÄôs empty words about Äòfamily valuesÄô letÄôs face it Äì he didnÄôt have any family values himself did he into their proper perspective Jenny is one of three children that Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando has with the Labour candidate Marlene Pullicino The marriage broke down some years ago but Jeffrey and Marlene remain obviously linked through their children
As Jenny points out here Sant the family values man did not even have the decency to inform his candidate Marlene Pullicino that he was about to unleash a horrible attack on the father of her children More to the point he was and remains completely indifferent to the fact that his candidate MarleneÄôs student daughter would suffer in the attack alongside her father whom she loves and supports
He is not only a coward but a man completely bereft of any idea of how family relationships function To him families are just a concept Äì something you read about in books as a theory
What a despicable man And a pathetic coward
Dearest Daphne
Thank you for shedding a human light on the situation
I am now at home unable to attend University in peace because I know that if I do I will be bombarded with questions To add insult to injury Labour journalists are adding me on Facebook in an attempt to scrounge up some dirt no doubt I call for these people to leave me alone let me be Let us be I was enraged when they used your son for political gain I was also targeted by Super One on the same day they filmed me for a substantial amount of time so much so that I was prompted by my friends to stop gesticulating wildly
Obviously using clips of me showing public disgust at SantÄôs behaviour could not be used on Super One especially once I put glasses on which made me look all the more like my mother a candidate for MLP Hats off to your son for telling them off You should honestly be proud of him The unprecedented lows that they have reached using children for political gain and infantile propaganda has only attracted disgust
I have made it public that I have particular political affiliations And while I encourage my mother to follow what she feels is right I have defended my right to an opinion which she has gracefully accepted This is in no way an attack on my motherÄôs credibility as a politician I think she is a clever woman who can give a lot to the MLP if she is given the chance to so do No I was not informed by my mother about the situation because she seems to not have known anything about it No Alfred Sant did not inform my mother He kept it within an inner circle ignoring the fact that his candidateÄôs exhusband was going to be under fire and her daughter a firsttime voter would along with her father suffer considerably for no apparent reason
You are not a man of honour DrSant Nor are you a Hero Nor are you capable of running a country The ÄòhamalliÄô at University refused to stand by your side and I was one of them Your deceitful tactics have jolted you into a low that is yet to be defined Non je ne regrette rien Well Done
I hope you did not show the same contempt for your own daughter as you have shown to the daughter of one of your candidates Thanks for making my father the HERO that he now is I am more proud of him than I ever was
Thanks again Daphne
Have a lovely day
Jenny Pullicino Orlando
  

  
A mole at PBS tells me that when Pullicino Orlando challenged Sant to sit down and take his two questions the insufferable JasonRobin said ÄòIbki Jeffrey ibkiÄô ÄòCry Jeffrey cryÄô
Then when Pullicino Orlando asked Sant to look him in the eye Sant muttered ÄòInt mÄôghandekx ghajnejnÄô ÄòYou have no eyesÄô
Yes he does Alfred Äì and very nice eyes they are too
  
 

Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil testified in court this morning as did the Prime MinisterÄôs More

  
Whenever the leader of the Labour Party is asked questions about the more embarrassing aspects of his past he says heÄôll leave it to the historians to decide because as far as heÄôs concerned itÄôs all water under the bridge and he has no regrets And this when nobody has bothered to ask him yet what he thought of the Labour governmentÄôs corruption and terrible moral and physical violence in the days when he was president of the Labour Party When Sant claims that he has zero tolerance for corruption now the first thing that comes to my mind is how accommodating he was to corruption at all levels in the mid1980s And those were the days when you couldnÄôt report it to the Commissioner of Police because not only was he a ÄòparaventuÄô for corruption in the real sense of the word but his men were not to be trusted LetÄôs say that this is some kind of act of redemption on SantÄôs part Äì protesting too much now because he didnÄôt protest enough or at all then
He doesnÄôt answer hypothetical questions
Herman Grech of The Sunday Times had a very trying interview with Alfred Sant a week ago He refused to answer what he described as hypothetical questions Maybe thatÄôs why throughout the entire four weeks of the electoral campaign so far nobody has been able to elicit from Sant an answer to this question What do you plan to do if you become prime minister
Now we know why he doesnÄôt tell us his plans He doesnÄôt deal in hypotheses So he doesnÄôt answer questions about the future because they are hypothetical and he doesnÄôt answer questions about the past because itÄôs all water under the bridge and for the historians to judge That doesnÄôt leave much for an interviewer to be going on with which is why Alfred Sant is every interviewerÄôs least favourite subject Äì except for the lovely Simone Cini that is because she isnÄôt exactly out to give him a good grilling
Alfred and Sir Humphrey
Ah but Sant broke his silence about the past when Herman asked him about his tussle with the redoubtable Joseph Grima who was head of the civil service when Sant was prime minister For those who donÄôt know him this man was a civil servant in the classic British mould He had Äì still has but he is retired now Äì the inscrutability of a dowager duchessÄôs butler and the allperceiving eyes of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister A civil servant since colonial times he did everything with perfect correctness You can imagine just how well he got along with Äòbazwar Äòl hawn bazwar Äòl hemmÄô Sant LetÄôs just say that it wasnÄôt love at first sight or at second sight either
So in a sea of turgid monosyllabic responses and refusals to answer questions about the past or future Sant became animated when Herman asked him one particular question about his time as prime minister Interestingly Sant appeared to feel that this particular bit of his past wasnÄôt water under the bridge or something for the historians to judge And so he gave Herman his version of the battle between the incoming prime minister and the inscrutable head of the civil service
A few days later Joseph Grima emerged briefly from retirement and unshackled by the Estacode spilt the beans on Sant in an article called Äì donÄôt you just love it Äì ÄúNothing but untruthsÄù I couldnÄôt have put it better myself So I read on until I came to the last paragraph which IÄôll quote for you here to save you the trouble of looking it up The Times 29 February
ÄúI have seen and experienced Dr Sant as prime minister at close range The foregoing is an illustration of how he operates I shall not elaborate further in that regard His selfdeclared bungling hallmark of ftit tbazwir Äòl hemm u ftit tbazwir Äòl hawn should be telling enough to me as a citizen and to all others It is selfevident that with Dr Sant at the helm Malta would have to face the Plan for a New Beginning of a Great Disaster In contrast Lawrence GonziÄôs outstanding achievements as prime minister are there for all to see Malta deserves Dr Gonzi as prime ministerÄù
If Sant owned a television set he famously does not he would have been able to watch reruns of Yes Minister and learn some useful lessons the most useful of which is this never cross Sir Humphrey
A Harvard certificate from the days of the Sex Pistols
In what looks to be an attempt at convincing us that he is the best man to run the country Alfred Sant has reproduced his 30yearold Harvard DBA certificate in the book written by his friend Frans Sammut who must be hoping for another position as adviser to the PM when Sant returns to the Auberge de Castille
ÄòAlfred Sant Äì IlVizjoni ghallBidlaÄô is now being sold at mass meetings and possibly also flung out of the windows of the kowc talbidla at waiting hordes of admirers I canÄôt imagine who might buy it except people like me who want a good giggle because itÄôs the most embarrassing sort of hagiography Something similar has probably been written about Kim Il Sung Äì though of course Kim Il Sung never went to Harvard and has no certificates to reproduce
Beneath the Harvard DBA photograph are the words translated from the Maltese ÄúAfter he finished his studies in Paris he went to America to study at the best university Harvard where the finest minds and the best presidents of the United States also studiedÄù The English translation is deliberately clumsy to reproduce the full effect of the original
The first thing that occurred to me when I saw the date on the thing was this why does Sant keep reminding us that he last trained in business administration when the Sex Pistols were screaming through the charts A lot has happened since then in business administration and styles of management But our hero is still stuck in the days of the immediate aftermath of the OPEC oil crisis when girls wore the kind of clothes that have come round again twice since then
No wonder he makes such a hash of things because as far as I can discern from this hagiography he never took a refresher course
Ah but the publicity press release that announced the book to the media is so beautifully devoid of irony that it is worth reproducing here in toto
ÄúAlfred Sant IlVizjoni GhallBidla is the latest publication by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti Written by novelist Frans Sammut it is an intimate portrait of a highbrow intellectual writer who turns into a politician and becomes the leader of a major political party with an agenda for change The book covers the periods when Dr Sant made his mark on contemporary literature with novels of adolescence and Min Hu Evelyn Costa That won the Broadcasting AuthorityÄôs TV drama award when Dr Sant was still a teenager His literary development is treated with a great wealth of detail and Mr SammutÄôs critical eye The passage to the practical implementation of the theories expounded in his books is explained perhaps for the first time Dr SantÄôs philosophy is spelt out in a racy style by a seasoned writer who has known the writerpolitician since their youth and is unsparing in supplying previously unrevealed detailsÄù
Those of you who have been led up the gardenpath by the double promise of a racy style and revealing details will be disappointed There is no sex in this book
Labour loves the lira
The other day it occurred to me that not once have I heard the Labour Party speak about euros in this entire electoral campaign To do this they must have made a careful point of avoiding all talk about money in actual figures Maybe thatÄôs why the shadow finance minister has been left without a leg to stand on Äì for if he canÄôt blind us with facts and figures what can he do Oh he can talk about DNA instead or stare uncomprehendingly at a reporter whoÄôs just asked him about the Gozo incinerator while the classy Justyne Caruana shouts over his shoulder ÄúMur xommuÄù
On Super One the other day Norman Hamilton the shadow minister of finance the wouldbe prime minister and the Lion of Change were talking up their promise of a ÄògrantÄô to firsttime homebuyers Except that itÄôs not a grant of course but a loan Äì because if and when you sell the property you have to pay the government back with interest Astonishingly they didnÄôt mention the word ÄòeurosÄô once even though youÄôd think it would be a good idea to tell potential voters just how much they stand to borrow from Labour instead of doing the sensible thing and popping into the nearest branch of HSBC
On the rare occasions that Sant has been forced to mention money he speaks about liri for all the world as though 1 January hadnÄôt come and gone LabourÄôs electoral manifesto is even more revealing as to the partyÄôs state of denial about the euro The bit about subsidised loans to firsttime homebuyers has fixed the price ceiling at Lm50000 a nice round figure up until 31 December 2007 but which gives us the rather odd figure of Ç¨116500 now When explaining LabourÄôs houseloans to perplexed reporters who suggested that this might force up prices Sant said ÄúWhoever sets the price at Lm56000 would consider selling at Lm49000 or Lm50000 to qualify under the schemeÄù
This was five weeks after Malta said goodbye to the lira for good He isnÄôt trying very hard to embrace the euro now is he
No respect
A front page headline in The Times read ÄòLabour will respect European CourtÄôs rulingÄô The reaction from readers was supposed to be a sigh of relief but some of us stopped to ask why that should be headline news in the first place The trouble is that we have become accustomed to Labour not respecting things The party has conditioned us to expect lower standards of behaviour from it than we would expect from the Nationalist Party Our tolerance threshold for poor conduct is higher for Labour than it is for the Nationalists We expect too little from Labour and thatÄôs precisely what we get
Picking a fight with Europe
The leader of the Labour Party and his two deputies the Lion of Change and Charlie ÄòDNAÄô Mangion tell us that they will get the best out of Europe Why do I feel a vague sense of nagging doubt of dire trepidation Maybe itÄôs because IÄôm a shallow person but the whole shabby package bothers me with its lack of style and panache I canÄôt imagine the Lion of Change fresh from a hunting trip to Romania or a bout with the fireworks people at Stella Maris Parish Church his lucky santa talMadonna safely in his pocket heading for Brussels to talk shop with the Eurocrats
Picture the same delegation that is now making pitstop tours of villages on the kowc talbidla piling onto the flight to Brussels faces grimly and determinedly set ready to tell those damned Europeans that nobody tells Malta what to do Heading the delegation are Hofra Sant Alla Hares Jitilghu lPagi Vella and the Lion of Change Embarrassing doesnÄôt even begin to describe it
I remember being in Brussels in the autumn of 1997 when Prime Minister Sant was torturing Malta on the rack of CET He had already been in power for a year and had wasted all that time trying to develop a new tax that was like VAT but not like VAT
I found myself in the unusual position of soothing the nerves of a semihysterical public servant who had been landed with the dismaying job of dealing with MaltaÄôs taxation problem frozen application and all they still had to deal with the EU The minute he found out I was Maltese and that I didnÄôt like the government he launched into a scathing description of the delegation that Prime Minister Sant had dispatched to Europe to woo favour for his mad tax It was spot on and there I
